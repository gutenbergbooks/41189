<p class="cap"><span class="upper">He</span> lay upon an old-fashioned bedstead
whose carved quaintness
would once have pleased him, but
to which he was now indifferent.
He rested upon his back, staring at the ceiling,
on whose white surface were twinkling
golden dots and lines in a network which even
his broken mind knew must be the sunlight
reflected from off the water somewhere. The
windows of the chamber were open, and the
sweet summer air came in laden with the perfume
of flowers piquantly mingled with pungent
sea odors. Now and then a bee buzzed
by the casement, or a butterfly seemed tempted
to enter the sick-room&mdash;apparently thought
better of it, and went on its careless way.</p>

<p>Of all these things the sick man who lay
there was unconscious, and the sweet young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
girl sitting by his bed was too deeply buried
in her book to notice them. For some time
there was no movement in the chamber, until,
the close of a chapter releasing for an instant
the reader&rsquo;s attention, she looked to discover
that the patient&rsquo;s eyes were open. Seeing
him awake, she rose and came a step nearer,
thereby making the second discovery, more
startling than the first, that the light of reason
had replaced in those eyes the stare of
delirium.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; she said, softly, &ldquo;you are awake!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The invalid turned his gaze toward her, far
too feeble to make any other movement; but
he made no attempt to speak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she continued, with that little purring
intonation which betrays the feminine
satisfaction at having a man helpless and unable
to resist coddling; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t speak. Take
your medicine, and go to sleep again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She put a firm, round arm beneath his
head, and bestowed upon him a spoonful of
a colorless liquid, afterward smoothing his pillows
with deft, swift touches. He submitted
with utter passiveness of mind and body, ignorant
who this maiden might be, where he
was, or, indeed, who he was. Painfully he
endeavored to think, to remember, to understand;
but with no result save confusing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
himself and bringing on an ache in his head.
His nurse, at the convenient end of another
chapter, observed a look of pain and trouble
upon the thin face, scarcely less white than
the pillow against which it rested.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are worrying,&rdquo; she observed with
authority. &ldquo;Go to sleep. You are not to
think yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And, staying himself upon the resolution
and confidence in her tone, he abandoned
himself again to the current of circumstances,
and drifted away into dreams.</p>

<p>The girl, watching closely now, with mind
distracted from her story to the more tangible
mystery involved in the presence of the
sick man, gave a little sigh of relief when
his even breathing indicated that he had
fallen asleep. She removed softly to a seat
near the window, and looked out upon the
tranquil beauty of the afternoon. Long
Island Sound lay before her, dimpling and
twinkling in the sunshine, while nearer a
sloping lawn stretched from the house to the
shore. Glancing backward and forward between
the sunny landscape and the bed where
her patient slept, the maiden fell to wondering
about him, recalling the little she knew,
and straining her fancy to construct the story
of his life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>Three weeks before a Sound steamer had
been wrecked so near this spot that through
the stormy night she had seen the glare of
the fire which broke out before the hull sank,
and the next morning&rsquo;s tide had brought to
shore this man, a floating waif, saved by a
life-preserver and some propitious current.
A terrible wound upon his head showed
where he had experienced some blow, and
left him hesitating with distraught brain between
life and death. In his delirium he had
muttered of varied scenes. He must, the
watcher reflected, have travelled extensively.
Now there were words which showed that he
was sharing in wild escapades; cries of defiance
or of encouragement to comrades whose
shadowy forms his disordered brain summoned
from the mysterious past; strange
names, and words in unknown tongues mingled
themselves with incoherent appeals or
bitter reproaches.</p>

<p>To the girl who had been scarcely less at
his bedside than the old woman who nominally
nursed him, these broken fragments
of wild talk had been like bits of jewels
from which her mind had fashioned a fantastic
mosaic. The mystery surrounding
the stranger would, in any case, have appealed
strongly to her quick fancy, but when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
to this was added the brilliancy of his delirious
ravings, it is small wonder that her imagination
took fire, and she wove endless romances,
in all of which the unconscious sick
man figured as the hero. Scraps of talk in
an unknown tongue, a few sonorous foreign
words, a little ignorance concerning matters
in reality commonplace enough, have, in
many a case before, been the sufficient foundations
for a gorgeous <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fata morgana</i> of fancy.</p>

<p>The stranger had been thrown ashore only
partially dressed, and with nothing upon him
which bore a name. A belt around his waist
contained about fifteen hundred dollars in
bills and a small quantity of gold-dust. From
the presence of this latter they had speculated
that the wounded man might be a returning
Californian, yet his clothing was of
too fine texture and manufacture for this supposition.
Several persons, seeking for friends
lost in the disaster from which he came, had
vainly endeavored to identify him, and his
description had been given in the New York
papers; but without result. There seemed,
upon the whole, to be no especial hope of
obtaining any satisfactory information regarding
the sick man until he was able to furnish
it himself; and to-day for the first time the
watcher found in his eyes the light of returning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
reason. She felt as if upon the threshold
of a great discovery. She smiled softly to
herself to think how eager she had become
over this mystery; to recognize how large a
place the stranger occupied in her thoughts;
yet she could but acknowledge to herself that
this was an inevitable consequence of the
existence which surrounded her.</p>

<p>The life into which the wounded man had
been driven by the currents of the sea and
those stronger currents of the universe which
we call Fate was a sufficiently monotonous
one. The household into which he had
been received consisted of an old gentleman,
broken alike in health and fortune, so that
while the establishment over which presided
his only child was not one of absolute want,
it was often straitened by the necessity of
uncomfortable economies. Alone with an
old family servant, the father and daughter
lived on in the homestead which the wealth
of their ancestors had improved, but which
their present revenues were inadequate to
preserve in proper state. One day with them
was so like every other day that the differences
of the calendar seemed purely empirical,
even when assisted by such diversity as
old Sarah, the faithful retainer, was able to
compass in the matter of the viands which,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
at stated periods in the week, appeared upon
their frugal table.</p>

<p>Old Mr. Dysart would have failed to perceive
the justice of the epithet &ldquo;selfish&rdquo; as
applied to himself; yet no word so perfectly
described him. He was absorbed in the compilation
of a complete genealogy of the entire
Dysart family, with all its ramifications and
allied branches. What became of his daughter
while he delved among musty parchments
in his stately old library; how the burdens of
the household were borne; and how a narrow
income was made to cover expenses,
were plainly matters upon which he could
not be expected to waste his valuable time.
The maiden could scarcely have been more
alone upon a desert island, or in a magic
tower. Her days followed each other with
slow, monotonous flow, like the sands in an
hour-glass,&mdash;each like the one before, and
each, too, like the one to follow.</p>

<p>Amid such a colorless waste of existence
the rich mystery of the wounded stranger
appeared doubly brilliant by contrast; and
it is small wonder that to the watcher the
first gleam of returning intelligence in the
sick man&rsquo;s eyes was as the promise of
the opening of a door behind which lay an
enchanted palace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was yet a day or two before the sick
man spoke. He was very weak, and lay for
the most part in a deathlike but health-giving
sleep. At length the day came when he said
feebly:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where am I?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; his nurse answered, with truly
feminine irrelevancy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At Glencarleon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He lay silent for some moments, evidently
struggling to attach some meaning to the
name, and to collect his strength for further
inquiries.</p>

<p>His eyes expressed his mental confusion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You were hurt in the steamer accident,&rdquo;
she explained. &ldquo;You came ashore here,
and are with friends. Don&rsquo;t try to talk. It
is all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was too feeble to remonstrate,&mdash;too
feeble even to reason, and he obeyed her
injunction of silence without protest. She
retreated to her favorite seat by the window,
and took up her sewing; but her revery
progressed more rapidly than her stitches,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
and when she was relieved from her post by
old Sarah, she stole softly out of the room
to continue her dreaming in an arbor overlooking
the water, where, in pleasant weather,
she was wont to spend her leisure hours.</p>

<p>The next day, when she gave her patient
his morning gruel, he watched her with questioning
eyes, as if endeavoring to identify
her, and at last framed another inquiry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am Columbine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Columbine?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Columbine Dysart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That he knew little more than before was
a consequence of the situation, and Mistress
Columbine was wise enough to spare him the
necessity of saying so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do not know us,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;but we
will take good care of you until you are well
enough to hear all about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo; he began, the puzzled look upon
his wan face not at all dissipated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she returned, &ldquo;there is no &lsquo;but&rsquo;
about it. It is all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; he repeated with an insistence that
would not be denied, &ldquo;but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; queried she, seeing that something
troubled him too much to be evaded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But who am I?&rdquo; he demanded, so earnestly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
that the absurdity of such a question
was lost in its pathos.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; she echoed, in bewilderment.
Then, with the instant reflection that
he was still too near delirium and brain-fever
to be allowed to trouble himself with speculations,
she added, brightly, and with the air
of one who settles all possible doubts, &ldquo;Why,
you are yourself, of course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She smiled so dazzlingly as she spoke that
a complete faith in her assurances mingled
itself with some dimly felt sense of the ludicrous
in the sick man&rsquo;s mind, and although
the baffled look did not at once disappear
from his face, yet he said nothing further,
and not long after he fell asleep, leaving
Columbine free to seek her arbor again and
ponder on this new phase of her interesting
case. She attached no serious importance
then to the fact that her patient seemed so
uncertain concerning his identity; but, as the
days went by, and he was as completely
unable to answer his own query as ever, a
strange, baffled feeling stole over her; a teasing
sense of being brought helplessly face to
face with a mystery to which she had no key.</p>

<p>His convalescence was somewhat slow, the
hurts he had received having been of a very
serious nature; but when he was able to leave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
his room, and even to accompany Columbine
to her favorite arbor, he was still grappling
vainly with the problem of who and what he
was.</p>

<p>This first visit to the arbor, it should be
noted, was an event in the quiet life at the old
house. Columbine was full of petty excitement
over it, her fair cheeks flushed and her
hair disordered with running to and fro to
see that the cushions were in place, the sun
shining at the right angle, and the breeze
not too fresh. She insisted upon supporting
the sick man on one side, while faithful old
Sarah, her nurse in childhood, and since
promoted to fill at once the place of housekeeper
and all the departed servants, took
his arm upon the other to help him along
the smoothly trodden path through the neglected
garden. Mr. Dysart was as usual in
his library, and to disturb him there was a
venture requiring more daring than either of
the women possessed. They got on very tolerably
without him, however, and the patient
was soon installed amid a pile of wraps and
shawls in the summer-house, where he was
left in charge of Miss Dysart, while Sarah
returned to her household avocations.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful day in the beginning of
September, warm and golden, with all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
mellowness of autumn in the air, while yet
the glow of summer was not wholly lost.
The soft sound of water on the shore was
heard through the chirping of innumerable
insects, shrilling out their delight in the heat;
while now and then the notes of a bird mingled
pleasantly in the harmony. The convalescent
drew in full breaths of the sweet
air with a sigh of satisfaction, leaning back
among his cushions to look, with the pleasure
of returning life, over the fair scene before
him.</p>

<p>For some time nurse and patient sat silent,
but the girl, watching him intently, was in no
wise dissatisfied with the other&rsquo;s evident appreciation
of her favorite spot. Indeed, she
had dreamed here of him so often that some
subtle clairvoyancy may have secretly put
him in harmony with the place before he
saw it. Columbine liked him for the pleasure
so evident upon his handsome, wasted
face, while inly she was aware how great
would have been her disappointment had he
been less alive to the charms of the view.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How lovely it is!&rdquo; he said, at length.
&ldquo;It is, perhaps, because you live in so lovely
a place,&rdquo; he added, after a trifling pause, and
with a faint smile, &ldquo;that you are so kind to a
waif like myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; she answered, returning his
smile. &ldquo;But, really, we only did what any
one would have done in our place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no; and besides, few could have done
it so well. It is so pleasant, I seem to have
lived here always.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It may be,&rdquo; Columbine suggested, with
deliberation, &ldquo;that it recalls some place you
have known.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A shadow came over his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a pity,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that if that unlucky
disaster could spare me nothing of my
baggage, it could not at least have left me my
few poor wits. I might make an interesting
case for psychologists. They might discover
from me in what part of the brain the faculty
of memory is located, for that wretched wound
seems to have let mine all ooze out of my
cranium. I do not feel, Miss Dysart, like an
idiot in all respects, since I certainly know my
right hand from my left; and I have found,
by experiment in the night-watches, that I
could still make myself understood in two or
three languages.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You had much better have slept,&rdquo; interpolated
his listener.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But as far as my personal history goes,&rdquo;
he continued, replying to her words by a
smile, &ldquo;my mind is an absolute blank. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
can give you several interesting pieces of
information concerning ancient history and
chronology; but I haven&rsquo;t the faintest idea
what my name is; and you must acknowledge
that it is a little hard for a man to be
ignorant of his own name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Columbine assented, bending forward
and clasping her hands in front of her
knees. &ldquo;Yes; and it is so strange! Try
and remember; you must surely recollect
something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have tried; I do try; but I can only
conjure up a confused mass of shifting images;
things I seem to have been and to have
done, all indistinguishably mixed with what I
have only dreamed or hoped to do and be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How strange!&rdquo; she said again, fixing her
wide-open dark eyes upon him, and then
turning her gaze to the sea beyond; &ldquo;but it
will come to you in time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heavens!&rdquo; he exclaimed, energetically,
&ldquo;I hope so, else I shall regret that you pulled
me out of the water. To-day I do seem to
have a glimpse of something more tangible.
Since I sat here I almost thought I remembered&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He broke off suddenly, his bright look fading
into an expression of helpless annoyance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; cried Columbine, eagerly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot tell,&rdquo; he groaned. &ldquo;It is all
gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, what a pity!&rdquo; exclaimed she, springing
to her feet in a flush of sympathy and
baffled curiosity. &ldquo;Oh, how cruel!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then she remembered that she was absolutely
disobeying the doctor&rsquo;s orders, and
was allowing her patient to become excited.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There, there,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;how wrong of
me to let you worry! Everything will come
back to you when you are stronger. Now
it is time for your luncheon. It is so warm
and bright you may have it here if you will
promise not to bother your head. For I
really think,&rdquo; she added, wisely, giving his
wraps a deft touch or two, &ldquo;that the best
way to remember is not to try.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dare say you are right,&rdquo; he agreed.
&ldquo;At least trying doesn&rsquo;t seem to accomplish
much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She flitted away, to return a moment or
two later with an old-fashioned salver, upon
which, in dainty china two or three generations
old, Sarah had arranged the invalid&rsquo;s
luncheon. She drew the rustic table up to
his side and served him, while he ate with
that mixture of eagerness and disinclination
which marks the appetite of one in the early
stages of a convalescence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;That pitcher,&rdquo; he observed, carelessly, as
she poured out the cream, &ldquo;ought to belong
to my past. It has a familiar look, as if it
could claim acquaintance if it would only
deign.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was my grandmother&rsquo;s,&rdquo; Columbine
said. &ldquo;When we were little, Cousin Tom
used to tease me by saying my cheeks looked
like those of that fat face on the handle. I
was more buxom then than now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Instead of replying, her companion laid
down his spoon and looked at her in delighted
amaze. Then he struck his hands
together with sudden vigor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tom!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Tom!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; queried she, looking at him as if
he had gone distraught. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t so strange
a name, is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, don&rsquo;t you see?&rdquo; he exclaimed,
joyously,&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Tom! I have found my
name!&rdquo;</p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> rest of Tom&rsquo;s name, however, remained
as profoundly and as provokingly
concealed in the wounded convolutions of
his brain as ever. Columbine called him Mr.
Tom, and it is not unlikely that the familiarity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
of the monosyllable, which seemed to
place them at once upon an intimate footing,
had a strong influence upon their relations.
The maiden had a crisp way of pronouncing
the name, as if she were half conscious of a
spice of impropriety in a term so familiar,
and felt it, too, to be something of a joke,
which was so wholly fascinating that the patient
did not have to be very far advanced
toward his normal condition of health and
spirits to enjoy it so well as to reflect that
the name so rendered ought to be enough
for any man.</p>

<p>Mr. Tom soon began to gather up a few
stray bits from his childhood, his memory
apparently returning to its former state by
the same slow road it had travelled from his
birth to reach it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I remember a few beginnings,&rdquo; he had
said, hopefully, on the day following that of
his first visit to the arbor. &ldquo;I had a carved
coral of a most luscious pink color. It is
even now vaguely connected in my mind
with the idea of eating; so I infer that I
must have cherished a fond delusion that it
was good to eat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is at least good to remember,&rdquo; Columbine
returned, laughing. &ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t be a
bad idea to open an account of things recovered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
from the sea of the past. You can
begin by putting down: Item, one coral.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; and one nurse. I distinctly recall
the nurse. She had a large mole on her
chin. Yes; I can certainly swear to the
nurse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was in excellent spirits to-day. The
dawning of recollection gave promise of
the restoration of complete remembrance;
the day was enchanting; his appetite and his
luncheon came to a wonderfully good agreement,
while a prettier serving-maid than Miss
Dysart could hardly be found.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It must be very like being a child again,&rdquo;
she observed, thoughtfully; &ldquo;and that is a
thing, you know, for which the poets are
always sighing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will have the advantage of growing
up with me,&rdquo; was his gay retort, &ldquo;if this
process continues. Only you&rsquo;ll have the advantage
of superior age.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After that he told her each morning what
he had been able to recover from forgetfulness
since the previous day. It is difficult
to imagine the strangeness of this relation.
It possessed all the piquancy of fiction to
which its ingenious author added new incidents
from day to day; yet it had, too, the
strong attractiveness of truth and personal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
interest. Columbine listened and commented,
deeply engrossed and fascinated by the novel
experience which gave her an acquaintance
with the entire past life of her stranger guest,
yet an acquaintance which was etherealized
and marked by a certain charm not to be
found in actual companionship. Had she
really shared the childhood thus narrated to
her it would have been in no way remarkable;
but now she seemed to live it herself,
with a vitality and interest more vivid each
day. Often the freakish faculty, upon whose
vigor depended the continuity of Mr. Tom&rsquo;s
narration, would for days concern itself with
the veriest trifles, advancing the essentials
of the story not a whit; or, again, it would
seem to turn perversely backward, although
no efforts availed to speed it forward.</p>

<p>The main facts of Mr. Tom&rsquo;s story, so far
as they were gathered up in the first week of
this odd story-telling, were as follows: He
made his acquaintance with the world doubly
orphaned, his father being lost at sea upon
a return voyage from India before the boy&rsquo;s
birth, and his mother dying in childbed.
Reflecting upon what he was able to recall,
Tom concluded that his parents were persons
of wealth. His surroundings had at least
been luxurious. The truth was, as he came,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
in time, to remember, that, being left without
near relatives, he had been, by his guardian,
confided to the care of trusty people, who
spoiled and adored him until he was transferred
to boarding-school.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have grown to be a dozen years old,&rdquo;
Tom remarked to Miss Dysart one afternoon
as they sat in the arbor, she sewing, and he
idly pulling to pieces a purple aster. &ldquo;I
have even conducted myself to boarding-school,
and I cannot conceive why I can&rsquo;t
get hold of my family name. I must have
been called by it sometimes. I remember
being dubbed Tom, Tommy, Thomas,&mdash;that
was when I was stubborn; Tom Titmouse&mdash;that
was by nurse; Tom Tattamus&mdash;that by
the particularly odious small boy next door;
but beyond that I might as well never have
had a name at all. My trunks, I know, were
marked with a big W, but all the names beginning
with that letter that I can hit upon
seem equally strange to me. I do not see
why, of all things, it is precisely that which
I cannot remember.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is because you worry about it,&rdquo; his
companion suggested; &ldquo;probably that particular
spot in your brain where your name
is lodged is kept irritated by your impatience.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Heavens!&rdquo; laughed he. &ldquo;How psychologic
and physiological you are! Well, if
I&rsquo;ve no name, I can invent one, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or make one. Do you realize what a
fascinating position you are in? Common
mortals have only the consolation of speculating
about their future; but you can also
amuse yourself with boundless speculations
concerning your past. You are relieved from
all responsibility&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; he interrupted; &ldquo;that is the
worst of it. I have responsibilities without
knowing what they are. The past holds me
like a giant from behind, and I cannot even
see my captor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you look at it all too seriously!&rdquo;
Columbine returned. &ldquo;You can fashion your
past, as we all do our futures, just as you like.
I think you are decidedly to be envied.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Envied!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The bitterness of the exclamation brought
to her a sudden realization of the difference
of their points of view, and revealed how
deep was the man&rsquo;s humiliation at his helpless
position. A quick flush of pity and sympathy
mantled her cheek.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forgive me,&rdquo; she exclaimed, impulsively.
&ldquo;I had no right to be so thoughtless. I
beg your pardon.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no occasion. You are right. It
is certainly better to laugh than to cry over
the inevitable, especially as things are righting
themselves. But we, or, rather, I, must
go into the house. It is growing cool.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>IV.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Life</span> at the old Dysart place went forward
in a slow and decorous fashion, little allied
to the bustling manners of the present day.
Mr. Dysart was getting now to be an old
man, albeit it is doubtful if in any abundant
sense he can ever have been a young one.
In any case he had, by long burrowing among
musty records and genealogical parchments,
acquired a dry and antique appearance, as,
to use a somewhat presumptuous yet not inexact
metaphor, certain scholarly worms had
taken on a brown hue from continued dining
on the bindings of his venerable folios. He
inhabited a remote and essentially unworldly
sphere, from which the existence of his
daughter was wholly separate. He was conscious
of her presence in an unrealizing
way; was even aware that just now she had
in the house a guest who had come ashore
from a wreck. But that was the affair of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
Columbine and old Sarah; he could not of
course be expected to loosen his hold upon
the clew which he hoped would lead him to
the exact connection between the Dysarts
and the Van Rensselaers of two generations
back, to pay attention to a chance waif from
that outer world with which he had never
considered it worth his while to concern
himself.</p>

<p>As far as Mr. Tom was concerned, Mr.
Dysart might as well not have existed. They
did once meet in the passage before the
study door when the invalid in his first days
of walking was one rainy morning wandering
restlessly about the halls; but the owner of
the house hurried furtively past, as if he were
the interloper and the other lord of the
manor; and even when the convalescent was
well enough to join the family at table, Mr.
Dysart was very seldom there, so that the
meals were for the most part taken <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tête-à-tête</i>
by Columbine and her patient.</p>

<p>The result of such a situation is evident
from the beginning. Exceptional natures
might be imagined, perhaps, that would not
have grown dangerously interested in each
other under such circumstances; but at least
these two drew every day closer together.
Neither had any tie belonging to the past;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
or, more exactly, Columbine had none, and
he, for the time being, at least, had no past.
His helplessness and the mystery enshrouding
him would have appealed to the heart of
any woman, and Columbine had no distractions
to fill her life and crowd out this ever-deepening
interest. Of Mr. Tom, her beauty
and freshness, her simplicity, which was so
far removed from insipidity, her innocence,
which never suggested ignorance, won the respect
and admiration long before he was conscious
that love, too, was growing in his heart.</p>

<p>There came a day, however, when he could
no longer be ignorant of the nature of his
feelings.</p>

<p>The two had gone past the arbor and down
to the shore. Columbine was seated upon a
rock, while Tom lay at her feet, idly tossing
pebbles into a pool left among the sea-weed
by the ebbing tide. The maiden wore that
day a dress of gray flannel, almost the color
of the stone upon which she sat, trimmed
with a velvet of orange which no complexion
less brilliant than hers could have endured.
She twisted in her fingers a spray of goldenrod,
yellow-coated harbinger of autumn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The summer is gone,&rdquo; Columbine remarked,
pensively. &ldquo;It is getting late even
for goldenrod.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he echoed, &ldquo;the summer is gone.
I lost so much of it I hardly realize&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He broke off suddenly, a new thought seizing
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;how long I have
been here! I ought to have taken myself off
your hands long ago. How you must think
I abuse your hospitality!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; she returned, brightly; &ldquo;you
of course cannot go until you are well. It
is necessary that you at least conjure from
the past the rest of your name before you
start out into the world again. Make yourself
as comfortable as you can, Mr. Tom;
you won&rsquo;t be let loose for a long time to
come yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Despite the lightness of her manner her
companion fancied he detected a shade of
some hitherto unnoted feeling in her words;
but whether dread of his departure or desire
to be rid of him he could not divine. The
latter thought struck him with a sudden chill.
The love which had been fostered in his mind
by this close and intimate companionship
was not unmixed at this moment with a fear
of being thrown upon his own resources while
ignorant alike of his place and his name. He
clung strongly to Columbine as to one who
understood and sympathized with his strange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
mental weakness. The color flamed into his
pale cheeks with a sudden throb of intense
emotion; then faded, to leave him whiter
than ever.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; Columbine continued, after a
moment&rsquo;s pause, her glance still downcast,
&ldquo;why shouldn&rsquo;t you stay? Your being here
makes no difference to papa; he smokes and
grubs after the roots of his ancestral tree the
same as ever; and as for me,&rdquo; lifting her
eyes with a sudden smile that showed all her
dimples, &ldquo;you know how much you amuse
me. You are as good as a continued story,
and are alive, too, the last being a good
deal in this desert.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He returned her smile with effort. His
moment of intense feeling had so overpowered
him that he felt weak and faint.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How white you are!&rdquo; she exclaimed,
noting the wanness of his face; &ldquo;you should
have had your <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bouillon</i> long ago. A pretty
condition you are in to go roaming off by
yourself!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She tripped lightly off towards the house
for the forgotten nourishment, and Mr. Tom
was left to his reflections. He raised himself,
as her graceful figure vanished, then sank
back upon his rug with something like a
groan. All in an instant the knowledge had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
come to him that he loved her. He had gone
on from day to day conscious only of thinking
of his own history, which, bit by bit, he was
disinterring from the past, as men bring to
light some buried city, and insensibly Columbine
had become dear to him before he
was aware.</p>

<p>He buried his face in his hands in a despair
which was in part the result of his strange
mental confusion; in part arose from his physical
weakness. He did not reflect then that
his case was not necessarily hopeless; that
nothing in his life which remembrance had
recovered need raise a barrier between himself
and Columbine. Afterward this thought
came to him and brought comfort; now he
was overwhelmed by a sense of impotent misery.
Helpless in the hand of fate, it seemed
to him that this love, of which he was newly
aware, was but a fresh device of malignant
destiny. He did not even consider whether
his affection might be returned; he only felt
the impossibility of offering his broken life to
Columbine,&mdash;of binding her to a past that
was uncertain and a future that was insecure.</p>

<p>Tears of weakness, and scorn of that weakness,
came into his eyes. Their traces were
still visible when Columbine returned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; she said, ignoring the signs of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
his agitation, &ldquo;you have told me nothing on
the story to-day. Just down there,&rdquo; indicating
by a pretty sweep of the hand a little
pebbly cove lying just below them, &ldquo;is where
Sarah and I found you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I would to God,&rdquo; cried poor Tom
with sudden fierceness, &ldquo;that you had left me
there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Columbine made, for the moment, no reply
to this outburst. She insisted upon his drinking
his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bouillon</i>, despite his protests of disinclination,
and then brought him back to the
tale of his life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is an air of improbability about
my story,&rdquo; he said, after a little musing.
&ldquo;Indeed, so much so that I myself begin to
doubt the truth of it. In the first place it
seems particularly arranged to baffle inquiry.
Whenever I recall a person to whom I might
send for verification or information, I straightway
remember that he is dead, or that my
wanderings have carried me beyond his
knowledge. I am apparently as far as ever
from knowing who I am or what I am. And,
besides, suppose your beautiful theory, that
my memory acts as it does because the impressions
of youth are strongest, is not true?
You put me in the same category with those
whose memory is weakened by age; but this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
may be all moonshine. Perhaps this history,
to which I am painfully adding every day, is
something I have read, and only a fiction
after all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why suppose so many tormenting
things?&rdquo; returned Columbine, brightly. &ldquo;The
fault of the age, they say,&mdash;we know very
little of it here, but cousin Tom sends me a
paper occasionally,&mdash;is unrest; and whoever
you are, a little tranquillity will scarcely be
likely to harm you. Go on with the life and
adventures, and never mind now whether
they are true or not. At least they are interesting.
You broke off yesterday in a most
exciting account of a tiger hunt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes; I got the rest of it together
this morning. Where did I leave off? Had
we reached the second jungle?&rdquo;</p>


<h3>V.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> salt meadows were on fire. The pungent
odor of burning peat and saline grasses
floated over the Dysart place and about the
arbor one October morning when Tom sat
there meditating. He was thinking of Columbine,
and of his passion for her. His
health now seemed firmly re-establishing itself,
and his memory had gone on over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
old track of his life in its singular method of
progression until he felt confident that he
should ultimately be in possession of all his
past. He reviewed what he remembered, as
he sat this morning inhaling the aromatic
scent of the burning lowlands, and the result
was not unsatisfactory. He had recovered
from oblivion his life up to the time, three
years before, when he took passage home
from India, and his financial affairs at that
period were in an eminently satisfactory position.
He recalled that he had been regarded
on shipboard as a person of more consequence
than the British officer who, with his
daughter, occupied the cabin of the Indiaman
with him; and he trusted that no untoward
circumstances of the interval had
placed him in a condition less desirable.</p>

<p>He had reconciled himself to remaining at
the Dysart mansion by turning over to old
Sarah a goodly portion of the money contained
in his travelling-belt, and blessed himself
that his wandering life had led him to
form the habit of always going thus provided.
He sat now waiting for Columbine to appear,
and fondly picturing to himself the delight
of telling his love when the time came that he
dare speak. Each day increased his attachment,
and he believed, as every lover will,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
that his love was returned. A smile of
brooding contentment, so deep that even the
impatience of his passion could not disturb
it, dwelt upon his face as he inhaled the fragrant
odors from the burning marshes, and
listened for the step of the maiden he loved.</p>

<p>She came at last, moving along the garden
paths between the faded shrubs, a gracious
and winning figure. She was dressed that
morning in a gown of russet wool, with a
bunch of gold and crimson leaves at her
throat, and never, in Tom&rsquo;s eyes, had she
looked so lovely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have been so late in getting
here,&rdquo; she said, as she took her accustomed
seat, &ldquo;but Sarah is greatly concerned about
the fire in the salt marshes. She says it is
thirty years since they burnt over, and she
presages all sorts of dire calamities from that
fact.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That they haven&rsquo;t burnt over for thirty
years?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Columbine returned with a pout,
&ldquo;she is not at all clear what she does mean,
so it isn&rsquo;t to be expected that I shall be.
We will go on with the life and adventures,
if you please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But suppose I haven&rsquo;t remembered anything
more?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; retorted pretty Columbine;
&ldquo;you never really remember. I am convinced
that you make it all up as you go
along; but you tell it so seriously that it
might as well be true. And in any case it
does credit to your powers of imagination.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His story now was of his voyage from
Calcutta. He told of moonlight nights in
the Indian ocean, of long days of sunny
idling on deck, and all the pleasant details
of a prosperous voyage over Southern seas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Grant wasn&rsquo;t very pretty,&rdquo; he observed,
lying lazily back and looking up into
the blue October sky, &ldquo;at least not as I remember
her; but she was very good company,
only a little given to sentimentalizing.
She had a guitar, and I will confess I did
hate to see that guitar come out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She would be pleased if she could hear
you,&rdquo; laughed Columbine. &ldquo;What was there
so frightful about her guitar?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, when she had that she always sang
moony songs, and after that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; demanded Miss Dysart, mischievously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, after that,&rdquo; he returned, with an impatient
shake of his shoulders, &ldquo;she was sure
to talk sentiment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His companion laughed merrily. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
faint, almost unconscious feeling of jealousy
which had risen at the mention of this engaging
young lady had vanished entirely in
the indifference with which Mr. Tom spoke
of her. She moved her head with a happy
little motion not unlike that with which a
bird plumes itself. Her soft, low laugh did
not really end, but lost itself among the
dimples of her cheeks.</p>

<p>Tom regarded her with shining eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not that I should mind some people&rsquo;s
talking sentiment,&rdquo; he said with a smile.</p>

<p>She raised her laughing gaze to his, and,
as their eyes met, the meaning of the look
in his was too plain to be mistaken. She
flushed and paled, dropping her gaze from
his.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And did nothing especial happen on the
voyage?&rdquo; she asked, with a strong effort to
regain her careless manner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not that I recall,&rdquo; he answered, putting
his hand beside hers upon the rustic table so
that their fingers almost touched.</p>

<p>A moment of silence followed, broken only
by the chirping of a few belated crickets,
that, despite the advancement of the season,
had not yet discontinued their autumnal concerts.
The two, so quiet outwardly, sat with
beating hearts, when suddenly a wandering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
breeze brought into the summer-house a puff
of smoke from the burning salt meadows. It
was laden with the fetid odor of consuming
animal matter, and so powerful was it that
both involuntarily turned away their heads.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; Columbine cried. &ldquo;How horrible!
There must be a dead animal of some
sort there that the fire has reached.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She stopped speaking and gazed with surprise
at Tom, who had buried his face in his
hands with a groan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it? Has it made you ill? It is
gone now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He lifted a face white with emotion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it has not made me ill,&mdash;physically,
that is; but it has done worse, it
has made me remember.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;What is it? is it
so terrible?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She leaned toward him, and to poor Tom
she looked the incarnation of enticing loveliness.
Sympathy and interest&mdash;not unmixed,
she being a woman, with curiosity&mdash;sparkled
in her eyes, yet he nerved himself to tell her
all that had come back to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That smell of burning hide,&rdquo; he began,
&ldquo;brought it all up in a flash. The ship got
on fire; Miss Grant clung to me; there was
just such an odor leaking out around the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
hatches from the hold where the flames were
at the cargo; she&mdash;I&mdash;when everything else
was right, when the fire was out, I was all
wrong.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not understand,&rdquo; Columbine said.</p>

<p>She drew away from him, her cheeks pale,
her very lips wan. She did not meet his
gaze, but sat with downcast eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was engaged to Miss Grant. I did not
pretend to love her, but I thought we were
all bound for the bottom, and&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>He stopped helplessly; her eyes flashed
upon him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And if a lie would soothe her last moments,&rdquo;
she said, bitterly, &ldquo;you&mdash; No, no; I
beg your pardon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I remember more,&rdquo; he went on, wrenching
each word out as if by a strong effort of
will. &ldquo;The shock, and, perhaps, previous
seeds of disease, were too much for her
father; he died the day before we landed.
She was alone in the world, she had no
protector, and I&mdash;I married her at once, to
protect her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A sparrow flew up into the lattice outside
the arbor without noticing the pair within,
so dead was the stillness which now fell upon
them. At length Columbine rose and stood
an instant by the table which had been between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
them. She wavered an instant, then
stooped and kissed him upon the forehead.
Then without a word she turned from the
arbor and fled swiftly to the house.</p>


<h3>VI.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Left</span> alone in the summer-house Tom&rsquo;s
first feeling was a great throb of joy; but
it gave place almost instantly to an aching
pang of misery. To be assured of Columbine&rsquo;s
love would have been intense happiness
an hour before; now it could only add
to his pain. He raged against the toils in
which fate had entangled him, yet defiance
to helplessness and every paroxysm of rage
at destiny ended in a new and humiliating
consciousness of his own impotence. He felt
like one who walked blindfolded, with light
granted him, not to avoid missteps, but merely
to see them after they were taken.</p>

<p>One thing at least was clear to Tom,&mdash;that
he must leave the Dysart mansion. To go
on seeing Columbine day after day, with the
knowledge at once of their love and of the
barrier that stood between them, was a position
too painful and too anomalous to be
endured. Both for his own sake and for Miss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
Dysart&rsquo;s it was necessary that he delay no
longer. Where he was going he was not at
all clear; that he left to circumstances to
decide. He quitted the arbor and walked
toward the house, so intent upon his painful
thoughts that at a turning of the path he
ran plump against old Sarah, who was hurrying
along with a face full of anxiety.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, mercy gracious, Mr. Thomas!&rdquo; the
faithful creature cried; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I beg your
pardon! But you look as if you&rsquo;d seen a
ghost!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So I have,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Where are
you going with that spade?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To the salt meadows,&rdquo; she answered.
&ldquo;The fire&rsquo;s sure to come into the lower
garden if we don&rsquo;t ditch it, and if it does,
there&rsquo;ll be no stopping it from the house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; exclaimed Tom. &ldquo;Where are
the men?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t no men,&rdquo; old Sarah returned,
philosophically. &ldquo;Why should there be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you are not going down to ditch
alone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;D I be likely to stop in-doors and let
the house where I&rsquo;ve lived fifty years burn
over my head?&rdquo; demanded she, grimly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give me the spade,&rdquo; was his reply. &ldquo;A
little work will do me good.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>Old Sarah remonstrated, but it ended in
the strangely matched pair going together
to the meadows below.</p>

<p>The dry sphagnum was readily cut through
with the spade, and it was not a difficult,
although a slow task, to dig a wide, shallow
trench between the stretch of burning moss
and the gardens. Once the ditch was complete,
it would be easy to fight the fire on the
home side, since there was nothing swift or
fierce about the conflagration, it being rather
a sullen, relentless smouldering of the moss
and grass-roots, dry from the long drought.</p>

<p>Zealously as the two labored, the fire gained
upon them, and as they worked, they could
not but cast despairing glances at the long
stretch of garden which lay still unprotected.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Columbine from her window
had seen the laborers, and, in a moment realizing
the danger, she flew to the library.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;the salt marshes
have been burning all day, and the fire is
almost up to the garden.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good heavens, Columbine, how impetuous
you are! You have quite driven out of
my head what became of the second son
of&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, father,&rdquo; she interrupted, impatiently,
&ldquo;do you realize that if you sit here pothering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
about second sons the house may be
burned over our heads?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Burned!&rdquo; exclaimed the genealogist, in
dismay; &ldquo;and all my papers scattered about!
Oh, help me, Columbine, to pack up my
notes; but don&rsquo;t take up anything without
asking me where it goes. Do you think that
iron-bound trunk will hold them all?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fearing to trust herself to reply, Columbine
darted from the library, leaving her father to
the half-frenzied collection of his papers, and
betook herself to the salt meadows, where,
grimed with smoke, Tom and the old serving
woman were sturdily laboring. The pungent
smoke eddied about them, and already
old Sarah&rsquo;s gown showed marks of having
been on fire in a dozen places. Columbine
stood upon the descending path a moment
and regarded them; then, with a step which
bespoke determination, she went on and
joined them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go back!&rdquo; shouted Tom, hoarsely, as
she approached; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you see how the
sparks are flying about? You&rsquo;ll be a-fire
before you know it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And, indeed, the fire was becoming more
active as it crept nearer to the edges of the
meadows, where the grass was taller. The
word of warning had hardly left Tom&rsquo;s lips<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
before she found her dress burning, and
while, being of wool, it was easily extinguished,
Tom found in it an excuse for taking
her in his arms to smother the flame.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go back to the house,&rdquo; he said, in a voice
which was full of feeling, yet which it would
have been impossible to disobey. &ldquo;We shall
save the place; but I cannot work while you
are in danger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you?&rdquo; she demanded, clasping her
hands upon his arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense! there is no danger for me,&rdquo;
he returned, smiling tenderly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think
of me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was not until late in the night that the
contest against the fire was concluded. Tom
worked with an energy in which desperation
had a large place, while old Sarah, with the
pathetic fidelity of an animal, labored by his
side, indefatigable and unmurmuring. Faint
streaks of light had begun to show in the
east when Tom flung down the spade, upon
which he had been leaning, for a last close
scrutiny.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is all right now,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;there can&rsquo;t
possibly be any fire left on this side of the
marshes. It was lucky for us that the tide
rose into the lower part of the trench.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Undemonstratively, as she had worked, old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
Sarah gathered herself together, grimy, stooping,
quivering with weariness and hunger, and
crept back to the house they had saved;
while Tom, with tired step, climbed the path
and took his way past the summer-house
toward the other side of the mansion. As he
passed the arbor something stirred within.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Columbine!&rdquo; he said, in surprise, recognizing
by some instinct that it was she.
&ldquo;Why, Columbine, what are you here for?
You will be chilled to death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You sent me away,&rdquo; returned the girl,
with a trace of dogged protest in her voice.
&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t let me help.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should hope not,&rdquo; laughed Tom, nervously,
taking off his hat and passing his hand
through his hair, from which odors of smoke
flowed as he stirred it. &ldquo;You were hardly
made to fight fire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she answered, with sudden and significant
vehemence, &ldquo;I was not made to fight
fire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He moved uneasily where he stood in the
darkness; then he took a stride forward and
sat down beside her. They were silent a moment,
his eyes fixed upon the first far sign of
dawn, while hers searched the gloom for his
features.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Columbine,&rdquo; he began, at length, in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
voice of strange softness, &ldquo;it would have been
better for us both if I had never come here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; was her eager reply; &ldquo;I cannot
have you say that. You have put savor into
my life that was so vapid before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But a bitter savor,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bitter, yes,&rdquo; Columbine returned in a
voice which, though low and restrained, betrayed
the fierceness of her excitement.
&ldquo;Bitter as death; but sweet too, sweet as&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She left the sentence unfinished. Below
on the shore the full tide was lapping the
stones with monotonous melody. Save for
their iterance, the stillness was almost as
deep as the marvellous silence of a winter
night which no sound of living thing breaks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whatever comes,&rdquo; Columbine murmured
a moment later, her voice changed and softened
so that he had to bend to catch her
words, &ldquo;I am glad of all that has happened;
glad of you; glad, always glad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He caught her passionately in his arms
and covered her downcast head with kisses,
while she yielded unresistingly to his embrace,
although she sobbed as if her heart
would break. In the east the promise of the
dawn shone steadily, increasing slowly but
surely. It became at last so strong that
Columbine, opening her swollen lids, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
able to distinguish objects a little. At that
moment she became conscious that the arms
of her lover had loosened their hold upon
her. She looked into his face with sudden
alarm. Mr. Tom had fallen into a dead faint.</p>


<h3>VII.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> afternoon sun was shining into Tom&rsquo;s
chamber windows when he awoke. Ten hours
of heavy sleep had had a wonderfully revigorating
effect upon him, and despite some
stiffness he awoke with a sense of renewed
power. His repose had, too, a far more remarkable
effect than this. Before his eyes
were open he said aloud, as if he were solemnly
summoning some culprit before the
bar of an awful tribunal:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thomas Wainwright!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sound of his own words acted upon
him like an electric shock. He started up
in bed, wide awake, his eyes shining, his
whole manner alert, joyous, and confident.
He was nameless no longer. Treacherous
memory had yielded up its tenaciously kept
secret, and at last he emerged from the shadowy
company of the nameless to be again a
man among men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>He sprang from his couch and made his
toilet with impatient eagerness. As he
dressed he remembered everything in an instant.
That baffling mystery of his family
name seemed the key to all the secrets of
his past, and, having yielded up this prime
fact, his memory made no further resistance.
His whole life lay before him, no longer laboriously
traced out, bit by bit, but unrolled
as a map, visible at a single <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup d&rsquo;&oelig;il</i>.</p>

<p>Little that he recalled was of a nature to
change the conclusions he had formed of his
circumstances, except the single fact that his
wife had not outlived her honeymoon. The
shock of her father&rsquo;s death, and, perhaps,
some seeds of malaria contracted in India,
had proved too much for her delicate constitution,
and Tom, eagerly reviewing his newly
recovered past, felt a pang of unselfish sorrow
for the unloved bride who had for so
short a time borne his name, that name which
he now kept saying over to himself, as if he
feared he might again forget it.</p>

<p>He hurried downstairs, and in the old-fashioned
hall, stately with its wainscoting
and antique carved furniture, he met Columbine
coming towards him. Like his, her eyes
shone with a new light, her lips were parted
with excitement, and her step was eager.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-morning, Mr. Wainwright,&rdquo; she
fluted in a voice high with excitement and
joyousness. &ldquo;I heard your step, and could
not wait for you to get to the parlor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo; cried he, stopping short
in amazement. &ldquo;How did you know? Are
you a witch?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she laughed, pleasure and excitement
mingling rather dangerously in her
mood. &ldquo;Nothing of the sort, I assure you;
though one of my ancestors was tried for
witchcraft at Salem. Cousin Tom sent me
this advertisement, and I knew at once that
it must be you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The advertisement she showed him was cut
from a New York paper, and called, with a
detailed description of the personal appearance
of the missing man, for tidings of one
Thomas Wainwright, of Baltimore, supposed
to have perished in the wreck of the Sound
steamer, and whose large estate was unsettled.
Tom read it over with mingled
feelings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;When I get home I
shall only have to look over a file of the
daily papers to read my obituary. Fortunately
I have been back from India so few
years that they cannot say a great deal about
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">De mortuis</i>,&rdquo; returned Columbine, smiling.
&ldquo;They will only say good of you. I
congratulate you on having found your
name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had it before you told me,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>He took her hands in his and looked at
her tenderly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have all my past, too,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;I
am free; I have nothing to hide; nothing
stands between us. Will you be my wife,
Columbine?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She grew pale as ashes; then flushed celestial
red; but her eyes did not flinch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I trust you utterly,&rdquo; she answered him.
&ldquo;And I love you no less.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>AN EPISODE IN MASK.</h2>


<p>[<i>Scene:&mdash;A balcony opening by a wide, curtained
window from a ball-room in which a masquerade is
in progress. Two maskers, the lady dressed as a
peasant girl of Britany and her companion as a
brigand, come out. The curtains fall behind them
so that they are hidden from those within.</i>]</p>

<p><i>He.</i> You waltz divinely, mademoiselle.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> Thank you. So I have been told before,
but I find that it depends entirely upon my
partner.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> You flatter me. Will you sit down?</p>

<p><i>She.</i> Thank you. How glad one is when a ball
is over. It is almost worth enduring it all, just to
experience the relief of getting through with it.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> What a world-weary sentiment for one so
young and doubtless so fair.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> Oh, everybody is young in a mask, and by
benefit of the same doubt, I suppose, everybody is
fair as well.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> It were easy in the present case to settle
all doubts by dropping the mask.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> No, thank you. The doubt does not
trouble me, so why should I take pains to dispel
it? Say I am five hundred; I feel it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p><i>He.</i> What indifference; and in one who waltzes
so well, too. Will you not give me another turn?</p>

<p><i>She.</i> Pardon me. I am tired.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> And you can resist music with such a sound
of the sea in it?</p>

<p><i>She.</i> It is not melancholy enough for the sea.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> Is the sea so solemn to you, then?</p>

<p><i>She.</i> Inexpressibly. It is just that&mdash;solemn.
It is too sad for anger, and too great and grave for
repining; it is as awful as fate.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> I confess it never struck me so.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> It did not me always. It was while I was
in Britany&mdash;where I got this peasant dress; isn&rsquo;t
it quaint?&mdash;that I learned to know the sea. It
judged me; it reiterated one burden over and over
until it seemed to me that I should go mad; yet
at the same time its calmness gave me self-control.
If there had been the slightest trace of anger or
relenting in its accusations, I could have turned
away easily enough, and shaken its influence all
off. But it was like an awful tribunal before which
I had to stand silent, and review my past as interpreted
by inexorable justice,&mdash;with no palliations,
no shams, nothing but honest truth. But why
should I say all this rigmarole to you? You must
be amused,&mdash;if you are not too much bored, that is.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> On the contrary, I thank you very much.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> For what?</p>

<p><i>He.</i> First, for your confidence in me; and second,
for telling me an experience so like my own.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
It was not the sea, but circumstances that delivered
me over to myself,&mdash;a long, slow convalescence,
in which I, too, had an interview with
the Nemesis of truth, and found a carefully built
structure of shams and self-deception go down as
mist before the sun. The most frightful being
in the world to encounter is one&rsquo;s estranged better
self.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> That is true. No one but myself could
have persuaded me that it was I who was to blame.
The more I was argued with, the more I believed
myself a martyr, and my husband&mdash;</p>

<p><i>He.</i> Your husband?</p>

<p><i>She.</i> I have betrayed myself. I am not mademoiselle,
but madame.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> But I see no&mdash;</p>

<p><i>She.</i> No ring? True; I returned that to my
husband before I went to Britany.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> And in Britany?</p>

<p><i>She.</i> In Britany I would have given the world
to have it back again.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> But your husband? Did he accept it so
easily?</p>

<p><i>She.</i> What else can a man do when his wife
casts him off?</p>

<p><i>He.</i> Do? Oh, it is considered proper in such
cases, I believe, for him to make a violent pretence
of not accepting his freedom.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> You seem to be sure he considered it
freedom!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p><i>He.</i> Pardon me. I forgot for the moment that
you were his wife.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> Compliments do not please me.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> Then you are not a woman.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> Will you be serious?</p>

<p><i>He.</i> Why should I be&mdash;at a ball?</p>

<p><i>She.</i> Because I choose.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> Oh, good and sufficient reason!</p>

<p><i>She.</i> But tell me soberly,&mdash;you are a man,&mdash;what
could my husband have done?</p>

<p><i>He.</i> Do you mean to make my ideas standards
by which to try him?</p>

<p><i>She.</i> Perhaps yes; perhaps no. At least tell
me what you think.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> A man need not accept a dismissal too
easily.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> But what then?</p>

<p><i>He.</i> He might have followed; he might have
argued. It is scarcely possible that you alone were
to blame. Was there nothing in which he might
have acknowledged himself wrong,&mdash;nothing with
which he should reproach himself?</p>

<p><i>She.</i> How can I tell what took place in his
heart? I only know my own. He may have repented
somewhat, or he may not. As for following&mdash; You
do not know my husband. He is
just, just, just. It was his one fault, I thought then.
It took time for me to appreciate the worth of
such a virtue.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> But what has that to do with following you?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p><i>She.</i> &lsquo;She has chosen,&rsquo; he would reason. &lsquo;Let
the event punish her; it is only right that she
should suffer for her own act.&rsquo;</p>

<p><i>He.</i> But is his justice never tempered by mercy?</p>

<p><i>She.</i> The highest mercy is to be just. To palliate
is merely to postpone sentence.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> You are the first woman I ever met who
would acknowledge that.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> Few women, I hope, have been taught by
an experience so hard as mine. But how dolefully
we are talking. Do say something amusing; we
are at a ball.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> I might give you an epigram for the one
with which you served me a moment ago, and
retort that to be amusing is to be insincere.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> Then&mdash;for we came to be amused&mdash;why
are we here?</p>

<p><i>He.</i> Manifestly because we prize insincerity.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> You are right. I came to get away from
myself. One must do something, and even the
dissipations of charity pall after a time.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> We seem to be in much the same frame
of mind, and perhaps cannot do better than to stay
where we are, consorting darkly, while the others
take pains to amuse themselves. So we get through
the evening, that is the main thing.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> You have forgotten to be as complimentary
as you were half an hour since.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> Have I? And yet the greatest compliment
a man can pay a woman is sincerity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p><i>She.</i> If he does not love her, yes.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> Ah, then you agree with Tom Moore:</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">&ldquo;While he lies, his heart is yours;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But oh! you&rsquo;ve wholly lost the youth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The instant that he tells you truth!&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p><i>She.</i> Perhaps; but it is no matter, since we were
not talking of love.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> But if we were?</p>

<p><i>She.</i> If we were we should undoubtedly say a
great many foolish things and quite as many false
ones.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> You are cynical.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> Oh, no. Cynicism is like a cravat, very
becoming to a man if properly worn, but always
setting ill upon a lady.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> Did you learn that, also, in Britany? It is
a country of enlightenment. Would that my wife
had gone there.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> Or her husband!</p>

<p><i>He.</i> You are keen. Her husband learned bitter
truths enough by staying at home. I am evidently
your complement; for I had a wedding-ring sent
back to me.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> And why?</p>

<p><i>He.</i> Why? Why? Who ever knows a woman&rsquo;s
reason! Because I refused, perhaps, to call black
white, to say I was pleased by what made me
angry; because&mdash; No; on the whole, since I am
not making love to her, it is hardly worth while to
lie to a peasant from Britany, though it is of course<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
necessary to sustain the social fictions with people
nearer home. It was because the wedding-ring
was a fetter that constrained my wife, body and
soul; because I was as inflexible as steel. My
purposes, my views, my beliefs were the Procrustean
bed upon which every act of hers was measured.
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Voila tout!</i></p>

<p><i>She.</i> I understand, I think.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> Oh, I have learned well enough where the
blame lay in the three years since she left me.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> Three years!</p>

<p><i>He.</i> Why do you start?</p>

<p><i>She.</i> It is three years, too, since I&mdash;</p>

<p><i>He.</i> Who are you?</p>

<p><i>She.</i> It is no matter; my husband is far from
here.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> That is more than I can say of my wife.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> Where is she, then?</p>

<p><i>He.</i> Heaven knows; not I. But let that go.
Why may we not be useful to each other? Our
cases are similar; we are both lonely.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> And strangers.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> Acquaintance is not a matter of time, but
of temperament. Should we have found it possible
to be so frank with one another had we been
merely strangers?</p>

<p><i>She.</i> You are specious.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> No; only honest.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> But what&mdash;</p>

<p><i>He.</i> What? Why, friendship. We have found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
it possible to be frank in masks; why not out of
them?</p>

<p><i>She.</i> Then you propose a platonic friendship?</p>

<p><i>He.</i> I want a woman who will be my friend,
to whom I can talk freely. There are words a
man has no power or wish to say to a man,
yet which must be spoken or they fester in his
mind.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> I am, then, to be a safety-valve.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> Every man must have a woman as a lodestar;
you are to be that to me.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> And your wife?</p>

<p><i>He.</i> My wife? She voluntarily abandoned me.
I haven&rsquo;t seen her for three years; and surely she
ought to cease to count by this time.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> You are heartless.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> Heartless?</p>

<p><i>She.</i> You should be faithful to your lost&mdash;</p>

<p><i>He.</i> Lost fiddlestick!</p>

<p><i>She.</i> You are very rude!</p>

<p><i>He.</i> I don&rsquo;t see&mdash;</p>

<p><i>She.</i> And very disagreeable.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> But&mdash;</p>

<p><i>She.</i> If you had really loved your wife, you&rsquo;d
always mourn for her, whatever she did.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> Good Heavens! That is like a woman.
A man is expected to bear anything, everything,
and if at last he does not come weeping to kiss the
hand that smites him, he is heartless, forsooth!
Bah! I am not a whipped puppy, thank you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p><i>She.</i> Your love was, perhaps, never distinguished
by meekness?</p>

<p><i>He.</i> I&rsquo;m afraid not.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> It might be none the worst for that. The
ideal man for whom I am looking will not be too
lamblike, even in love.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> You look for an ideal man, then?</p>

<p><i>She.</i> As closely as did Diogenes.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> And your husband?</p>

<p><i>She.</i> Oh, like your wife, he should, perhaps,
begin not to count.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> Good. We are sworn friends, then, until you
find your ideal man.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> If you will.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> Then unmask.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> Is that in the bargain?</p>

<p><i>He.</i> Of course. Else how should we know each
other again?</p>

<p><i>She.</i> But&mdash;</p>

<p><i>He.</i> Unmask!</p>

<p><i>She.</i> Very well,&mdash;when you do.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> Now, then. [<i>They unmask.</i>]</p>

<p><i>She.</i> Philip!</p>

<p><i>He.</i> Agnes!</p>

<p><i>She.</i> You knew all the time!</p>

<p><i>He.</i> Who told you I was here?</p>

<p><i>She.</i> I didn&rsquo;t know it.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> I thought you went to Russia.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> Well, I didn&rsquo;t. I hope you feel better!
Good night.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> Wait, Agnes. I&mdash;</p>

at each other intently. He takes her hand in both

<p><i>He.</i> Agnes, I am not your ideal man, but&mdash;</p>

<p><i>She.</i> Nor I your ideal woman, apparently. Your
wife does not count, you say.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> No more than your husband; so we are
quits there.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> It&rsquo;s very horrid of you to remind me of
that.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> I acknowledge that I was always very horrid
in everything.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> Oh, if you acknowledge that, Phil, it is
hardly worth while to spend any more time in explanations
while this divine waltz is running to
waste.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> But you were tired and out of sorts.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> You old goose, don&rsquo;t you see that I&rsquo;m
neither!</p>

<p><i>He.</i> And you do waltz divinely.</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">&ldquo;I shall</span> feel honored, Mistress
Henshaw, if you will accept this
posie as a token which may perchance
serve to keep me in remembrance
while I am over the sea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am extremely beholden to you,&rdquo; replied
the old dame addressed, her wrinkled face
illuminated with a smile of pleasure. &ldquo;But
for keeping you in remembrance it needs not
this posie or other token. I do not hold my
friends so lightly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thank you for counting me one of your
friends,&rdquo; John Friendleton said frankly. &ldquo;I
have no kindlier memories of Boston than
of the home under your roof.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He had placed upon the many-legged
table a flower-pot containing a thrifty tuberose,
and with a kindly smile upon his handsome
and winning face, he stood regarding
the old dame into whose custody he had just
given the plant. The dress of the period,&mdash;the
days of the end of the seventeenth century,&mdash;plain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
though it was, accorded well
with the sturdy honesty and kindness of his
face and the compact and strong build of
his figure. The wrinkled crone returned
his smile with one of frosty but genuine
warmth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This plant is none the less pleasing to
me,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;though I by no means need
it as a reminder. I shall be very careful in
its nourishing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is by no means an ordinary herb,&rdquo;
Friendleton returned lightly. &ldquo;There may
be magic in it for aught I can tell. My
uncle, who sent me the bulbs from even so
far away as Spain, hath a shrewd name as
a wise man; and to say sooth he belike doth
know far more than altogether becometh a
good Christian. I give you fair warning that
there may be mischief in the herb; though
to be sure,&rdquo; he added laughing, &ldquo;the earth
in which it grows is consecrated, for I filled
the pot from Copp&rsquo;s Hill graveyard hard by
here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A momentary gleam shot with a sinister
light its fiery sparkle across the black eyes of
Mistress Henshaw.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To one who feareth no harm,&rdquo; she answered,
&ldquo;it seldom haps. I trust the wind
may hold fair for your sailing,&rdquo; she added,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
glancing from the small-paned window, &ldquo;and
that you may safely return to Boston as you
are minded.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, I have hitherto been much
favored by Providence in my journeyings.
Farewell, Mistress Henshaw.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old dame received his adieu, and a
moment later she watched from the window
his active young figure as he walked briskly
away. She regarded it intently until a corner
hid him from sight. Then she turned
back to her room and her occupations.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Providence, indeed!&rdquo; she muttered half
aloud, with a world of contempt in her tone.</p>

<p>Then she turned to the thrifty, healthy
tuberose and caressed its leaves with her
thin old fingers as if it were alive and could
understand her attentions.</p>

<p>The house in which this conversation took
place was still standing a few years since, the
oldest in Boston, at the corner of Moon and
Sun Court streets. It was erected in 1669;
its timber, tradition says, being cut in the
neighborhood. The upper story projected
over the lower like a frowning brow, from
beneath which the windows shone at night
like the glowing eye-balls of a wild beast.
It was a stout and almost warlike-looking
edifice, which preserved even up to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
day when, in 1878, it was at length pulled
down by the hand of progress, a certain
strongly individual appearance, which if less
marked at the time when John Friendleton
bade Mistress Henshaw good-by, and the
building was thirty years old, must always
have distinguished the dwelling from those
about it.</p>

<p>Dwellings, however, take much of their air
from dwellers, and Mistress Henshaw was
likely to impart to any house she inhabited
a bearing unlike that of its neighbors. She
was a dame to all appearances of some three
score winters, each frosty season having left
its snow upon her hair. Her figure was still
erect, while her eyes were piercing and black
and capable of a glance of such strength and
directness as almost to seem supernatural.</p>

<p>It may have been from the power and fervor
of this glance that Mistress Henshaw
acquired the uncanny reputation which she
enjoyed in Boston. As she moved with surprising
energy about the house, overseeing
and directing her dumb negro servant Dinah,
the eyes of passers-by who saw her erect
figure flit by the windows were half averted
as if from some deadly thing which yet held
them with a weird fascination; and at nightfall
the children whom chance belated in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
neighborhood went skurrying past Dame
Henshaw&rsquo;s house like frightened hares.</p>

<p>It is not perhaps to be told why Satan
should have been able to establish his kingdom
among a people so devout and pious as
the godly inhabitants of the Massachusetts
colony; yet we have it upon the testimony
of no less a man than the sage and reverend
Cotton Mather, whose sepulchre is with us
unto this day, and upon the word of many
another scarcely less wise and devout, that
the Father of Evil did establish a peculiar
and covenant people of his own in the midst
of the very elect of New England. It may
be that it is always as it was in the days of
Job, and that the sons of God never assemble
without finding in their midst the dark form
of Lucifer; for certain it is that the devil, to
quote the Rev. Cotton Mather&rsquo;s own words,
&ldquo;broke in upon the country after as astonishing
a manner as was ever heard of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Flashy people,&rdquo; quaintly and solemnly
remarks the learned divine, &ldquo;may burlesque
these things, but when hundreds of the most
sober people in a country where they have
as much <em>mother-wit</em> certainly as the rest of
mankind, know them to be <em>true</em>, nothing but
the absurd and forward spirit of <em>Sadducism</em>
can question them.&rdquo; From all of which,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
and from much more which might be cited, it
is evident that there was plenty of witchcraft
abroad in those days, whether Mistress Henshaw
was concerned therein or not.</p>

<p>It is sufficient to note that certain gossips
scrupled not to declare that Dame Henshaw
was one of the accursed who bore the mark
of the beast and kept tryst at the orgies
of the witches&rsquo; sabbath, and the report once
started the facts in the case made little difference.
Some of her neighbors went so far
as to declare that if the dame&rsquo;s residence
were forcibly changed from Sun Court street
to Prison lane, the community would be the
better off.</p>

<p>Governor Belamont, however, in this last
year of the century, was far more exercised
about pirates than concerning witches; and
better pleased at the capture of Captain Kidd,
who had just fallen into his hands, than if he
had discovered all the wise women in the
colonies. Public feeling, moreover, was still
in a reactionary state from the horrors of the
Salem delusion of 1692; and thus it came
about that Mistress Henshaw was left unmolested.</p>

<p>The second person in the dialogue given
above, John Friendleton, was an Englishman,
and, if tradition be true, the son of an old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
lover of Mistress Henshaw. He had taken
up his abode with that lady upon his arrival
in the New World, whither he had been led,
like many another stout young blade of his
day, by the hope of finding fair fortunes in
the growing colonies, and from the first he
had been a favorite with the old lady. It
was whispered over certain of those tea-cups
which we now tenderly cherish from a respect
for the memory of very great grandmothers
and an æsthetic enjoyment of the
beauties of old china, that it was by the aid
of unhallowed power exercised in his behalf
that the young man was always so fortunate
in his undertakings. There were sinister tales
of singular coincidences which had worked
for his good, and behind which the gossips
believed to lie the instigating will of his
powerful landlady. Whether he himself was
aware of this supernatural aid, opinion was
divided, but he was so frank and handsome
withal that the weight of opinion leaned
toward acquitting him. The habit of New
England thought, moreover, was so opposed
to imagining a witch as exercising her power
for anything but evil, that these rumors after
all gained no great or general credence.</p>

<p>The friendship between the dame and her
lodger was perhaps based upon mutual need.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
The young man gave her that full confidence
which a pure-minded youth enjoys bestowing
upon an elderly female friend; while in turn
the childless old lady, alone and otherwise
friendless, regarded him with tender affection.
She cherished any chance token from
him, and especially did she seem touched by
this gift of a tuberose which he had given her
at parting. She knew how carefully he had
tended and cherished the plant, more rare
then than now, and long after the sails of the
ship which conveyed him to England, whither
he had been summoned by the serious illness
of a relative, had dipped under the horizon,
the old witch&mdash;if witch she were&mdash;sat regarding
the flower with eyes in which the
tears glistened.</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was early springtime when John Friendleton
once more caught sight of the beacon
upon Trimountain, and the walls of the fort
standing upon a hill which has itself been removed
by the enterprise of Boston. The few
months of the young man&rsquo;s absence, and the
progress of time from one century to another&mdash;for
it was now 1700&mdash;had brought no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
great changes to the town; but to him it
seemed far from being the same he had left.</p>

<p>The first tidings he had received from Boston,
after landing in England, had been a
letter telling of the death of Mistress Henshaw.
She had set out from Boston, so
the letter informed him, to visit a sister living
somewhere in the wilds toward far Pemaquid,
and had never returned. The letter was
written by one Rose Dalton, who claimed
to be a niece of the deceased, and who
had come into possession of the small property
of Mistress Henshaw by virtue of a
will made before the adventurous and fatal
journey. The writer added to her letter the
information that she should live on with
dumb Dinah, holding as nearly as possible
to the fashion of her aunt&rsquo;s housekeeping.</p>

<p>When John stood once more upon the well-remembered
threshold, he felt half disposed
to turn away and enter no more a place in
which every familiar sight could but call up
sad memories. Then, endeavoring to shake
off his melancholy, he knocked.</p>

<p>A light, brisk step approached from within,
and the door opened quickly.</p>

<p>John stood in amazement, unable to utter
a word, so bewildered was he by the beauty
of the maiden who stood before him; a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
beauty which now, after nearly two centuries,
is still a tradition of marvel. Something
unreal and almost supernatural there might
seem in the wonderful loveliness of this exquisite
creature, were it not that she seemed
so to overflow with life and vitality. Her
soft and dove like eyes were full of gleams
of human energy, of joy, of passion; she
had all the beauty of a perfect dream without
its unreality; and then and there the
young Englishman&rsquo;s heart fell down and
worshipped her, never after to swerve from
its allegiance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must be Mr. Friendleton,&rdquo; the
maiden said, courtesying bewitchingly. &ldquo;I
knew your ship was in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I have been minding my luggage,&rdquo;
he stammered, rather irrelevantly, his eyes
fastened upon her face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be pleased to enter,&rdquo; said she, smiling a
little at the boldness and unconsciousness of
his stare. &ldquo;Your room has been preserved
as you left it at your departure. My aunt,
good Mistress Henshaw, as I wrote you,
straitly enjoined in her will that everything
should be kept for you as you had left it.
Her affections were marvellously set upon
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That he should be allowed to enter under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
the same roof with this beautiful creature
seemed to John Friendleton the height of
bliss, and he had no words to express his
delight when he learned that Mistress Rose
expected him to take up his abode there as
in former times. Her aunt had wished it;
had especially spoken of it in her will, and
so it was to be.</p>

<p>It would be impossible to pretend that
Friendleton struggled much against this proposition,
when inclination so strongly pleaded
for the carrying out of the wishes of his
dead friend; and in this way he became
the lodger of young Mistress Rose.</p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> did not long escape the eye of the
young man that his new landlady wore
always at her throat a cluster of the white,
waxy blossoms of the tuberose. The circumstance
was in itself sufficiently curious
and unusual to excite his attention, and it
recalled to his mind the plant he had given
to Mistress Henshaw. He wondered what
had been the fate of his gift, and one day he
ventured to ask Mistress Rose about it. For
reply she led him to the room formerly occupied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
by her aunt, and showed him the tuberose
in a quaint pot. It had grown tall and
thrifty, and half a dozen slim stalks upon it
stood up stoutly, covered with buds, which
showed here and there touches of dull red
evolved in their transformation from green to
white.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I marvel how it hath increased,&rdquo; John
said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It hath thriven marvellously,&rdquo; she replied.
&ldquo;Never before hath it been known that the
plant would bloom throughout all the year,
but this sends out buds continually. I daily
wear a blossom, as you may see, and I find
its odor wonderfully cheering, although for
most it is too powerfully sweet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is an ornament which becometh you
exceedingly well,&rdquo; he responded, flushing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My neighbors,&rdquo; returned she smiling,
&ldquo;regard it as exceeding frivolous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The fragrance of the flower which Mistress
Rose wore at her throat floated about John
wherever his daily occupations led him, and
doubly did the delicious perfume steal through
his dreams. He never thought of the maiden
without feeling in the air that divinely sweet
odor; and a thousand times he secretly compared
her to the flower she wore. Nor was
the comparison inapt; since her beauty was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
rendered somewhat unearthly by the strange
pallor of her face, while the intense and
passionate intoxication it produced might,
without great straining of the simile, be directly
compared to the exaltation which the
delicious and powerful fragrance produces
in sensuous and sensitive natures.</p>

<p>The intimacy between the young people
was at first hindered by the shyness of
Friendleton, who was only too conscious of
the fervor and depth of his passion; but as
Rose had many of the well-remembered ways
of her aunt, and, stranger yet, appeared well
versed in his own past history, he soon
became more at his ease. In defiance of
the proverb which condemns all true lovers
to uneven ways and obstructed paths, the
wooing of lovely Mistress Rose by John
Friendleton ran smoothly and happily on,
seeming to have begun with the young man&rsquo;s
first meeting with his lovely landlady. The
gossips of Boston town, strangely enough,
left the relations of the lovers untouched
by any but friendly comment; and in a fashion
as natural as the ripening of the year,
their love ripened into completeness.</p>

<p>It was early autumn when Rose became
Mistress Friendleton. The wedding was quietly
celebrated in the old North Church,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
and never in its century of existence before
its timbers went to feed the campfires of
British soldiers, did that house shelter a
more lovely bride or a more manly and
blissful groom. A faint flush softened the
pallor of the maiden, the one charm which
could add to her beauty. Her only ornament
was her usual cluster of tuberoses, and
more than one spectator noted how like the
flower was the lady. The circumstance was
recalled afterward when the slab was placed
above her grave in Copp&rsquo;s Hill burial-ground.
There still lingers among certain old gossips
of tenacious memory the tradition of a stone
which had on it &ldquo;some sort of a flower.&rdquo; It
was the slab upon which John Friendleton,
imaginative at sorest need, had caused to be
carved simply a bunch of tuberoses.</p>

<p>If John had been happy in anticipation, he
was, if such a thing be possible, no less so in
reality. It is as trite to attempt as it is impossible
to effect the portraying of the life
of two young people who are profoundly
happy in each other. Joy may be named,
but not painted. Even were it easy to picture
their existence, their self-absorption
would prevent their being interesting. As
I have sometimes passed the old house on
Moon Street, standing worn and stained with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
the storms of two centuries, a picture has
risen before me of the young bride and
groom sitting together and inhaling the fragrance
of a quaint pot of tuberoses, blooming
so wonderfully that the whole house was
filled with their odor; and the memory
brings always the tears to my eyes.</p>


<h3>IV.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">November</span> was at its last day. A severe
storm, half rain, half snow, was sweeping over
Boston. The beacon upon Trimount trembled
in the blast, and on the shores of the
peninsula the waves roared sullenly. Few
people were abroad, and there was never a
watchman in the city who did not for that
day at least regret having chosen a calling
which kept him out of doors in such weather.</p>

<p>The house on Sun Court Street was too
stoutly built to tremble, yet those within
heard the wind howling over the hill as if
scourged by all the furies. It was one of
those nights when a man sits before his fire
and realizes the value of all his blessings.</p>

<p>John and Rose sat together before the
blazing hearth while the husband told stories
of his boyhood in England. The wife<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
nestled close to him, absorbed in the narration,
yet not forgetting to fondle his hand
with her smooth, soft fingers.</p>

<p>Suddenly into the room burst black, dumb
Dinah, wringing her hands and moving her
speechless lips with frightful earnestness.
In her hands she carried the fragments of
the pot which had held the tuberose.</p>

<p>Rose sprang up with a cry of anguish.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dinah! Dinah! My tuberose!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The negress gesticulated wildly, but her
mistress rushed past her; and, followed by
her husband, hastened to see for herself the
extent of the mischief.</p>

<p>The pot had been overturned by the wind,
which had burst in one of the tiny greenish
window panes, and the plant was completely
crushed in the downfall. Not a single flower
had escaped, and mingled with fragments of
pottery and with the black church-yard mould
in which the flower had&mdash;perhaps ill-fatedly&mdash;been
planted, were the leaves and petals,
torn and stained and mangled.</p>

<p>In the first sorrow of the discovery of the
accident, Rose threw herself into her husband&rsquo;s
arms and burst into tears; but she
soon controlled herself, and became perfectly
calm. She directed Dinah to remove the
débris, and returned to listen to her husband&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
stories; and, although she was more quiet
than before, she seemed no less interested.</p>

<p>It was late when they prepared to retire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;John,&rdquo; Rose said, hesitatingly, as they
lingered a moment side by side before the
wide hearth, &ldquo;it is just a year to-night since
Mistress Henshaw died. If you are willing,
I wish to pass the night alone in her room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am always willing you should do whatever
pleaseth you best,&rdquo; he answered, smiling
upon her; &ldquo;but why do you mean to shut
me out from your sorrow? I, too, loved
her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Rose returned, bending to kiss
the hand he had laid upon hers, &ldquo;and I fear
you can never be shut out from my sorrows,
however much I could wish to spare you.
Still, I wish it to be so for to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then let it be so. The storm does not
fright you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The storm does not fright me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She took from her throat the tuberoses she
had worn that day, and gazed at them sadly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can never wear another,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;These are faded like our happy days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You speak but sadly,&rdquo; returned her husband,
with a look of such fondness that the
tears started into her eyes despite all her
efforts to restrain them. &ldquo;You would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
spoken so had you been bidding me farewell.
The destruction of the flower makes you
downcast. Mayhap there is still life in the
root, and it may be made once more to grow
and bloom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;John,&rdquo; his wife said abruptly, &ldquo;John, I
have loved you from the first moment I saw
you; I love you now, and I shall love you to
all eternity. Whatever happens, remember
that and believe it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have never doubted that you love me,&rdquo;
he answered, gathering her into his arms;
&ldquo;how else could it be that you could have
made me so utterly happy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She clung to him passionately a moment.
Then with an evident effort at self-control,
she kissed his lips fervently, disengaged herself
from his embrace, and turned away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-night, dear,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>Then upon the threshold of Mistress Henshaw&rsquo;s
chamber she paused and looked back,
tears shining in her beautiful dark eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-night,&rdquo; she repeated; &ldquo;good-night.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>V.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was somewhat past his usual hour of
rising when John Friendleton next morning
came downstairs. The storm was over, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
everywhere had it left its traces in broken
boughs, overturned fences, and dilapidated
chimneys, so that as he looked from the window,
John could see on all sides the evidences
of its violence.</p>

<p>The house was strangely quiet, and he
looked about him with the impatience of a
lover for his wife, that she might chase away
the unaccustomed sombreness which seemed
to have descended upon the place.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dinah,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;has not your mistress
risen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The mute regarded him with a strange
appearance of wildness and terror, but she
replied by a shake of the head,&mdash;instantly
hurrying out of the room as if in fear.</p>

<p>John looked after her an instant in bewilderment,
not understanding her odd manner;
and then approaching the door of the room
occupied by his wife, he tapped softly.</p>

<p>There was no response.</p>

<p>He tapped again somewhat more loudly.
Still there was no reply. A third time he
rapped, now with a heavy hand. All within
was as silent as the grave.</p>

<p>Startled by he knew not what fear, with a
sudden impulse he set his strong shoulder to
the door, and strained until with a crash it
flew open.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>The heavy curtains were undrawn, and a
grey gloom filled the chamber. A fearful
silence followed the crash of the breaking
lock, and met him like a palpable terror.
He saw Rose lying on the bed, her face buried
in the pillows; and by some fantastic jugglery,
the light from the open door, as it fell
upon her hair,&mdash;those abundant tresses
whose rich, dark glory he so loved,&mdash;seemed
to silver them to the whiteness of hoary age.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rose!&rdquo; he cried, starting forward to
seize her hand which lay upon the coverlid.</p>

<p>The hand was cold with a chill which
smote him to the very heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rose! Sweetheart!&rdquo; he cried in a piercing
voice, bending over and tenderly turning
her dear face up to the light.</p>

<p>What horrible mockery confronted him?
He started back like one stung by a serpent!</p>

<p>Along the pillow lay a crushed and withered
tuberose, and he looked upon the face,
ghastly in death, and old and haggard and
wrinkled&mdash;of Mistress Henshaw.</p>

<h2>AN EVENING AT WHIST.</h2>

<p>[<i>The scene is the parlor of a modern house, much
adorned, and furnished with a wealth of bric-a-brac,
which renders getting about a most difficult and delicate
operation, unless one is wholly regardless of the
consequences to the innumerable ornaments. Mrs.
Greeleigh Vaughn, a corpulent and well-preserved
widow, who passes for forty, and is not less, has just
seated herself at the whist-table, with her daughter
and two guests. One of these, Mr. Amptill Talbot, is
one of those young men whose wits seem to be in some
mysterious fashion closely connected with the parting
of their hair exactly in the middle; the other is a
handsome and keen-eyed gentleman of middle age, who
answers to the name Colonel Graham.</i>]</p>


<p><i>Mrs. Vaughn.</i> I am so glad you could and
would come, Colonel Graham. Now we shall
have a delightful evening at whist. You are such
a superb player that I am sure I shall learn more
about the game by playing with you a single evening
than I should by studying the books for a year.</p>

<p><i>Colonel Graham.</i> You are too good. I make
not the slightest pretence of&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mrs. V.</i> Oh, of course not. You are too modest;
but everybody says that you are a wonderful
player. I only hope you won&rsquo;t be too hard on me
if I make a mistake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Miss Vaughn.</i> Oh, I am so glad mamma is
your partner, Colonel Graham. I should be frightened
to death if I had to play with you. Mr.
Talbot will be a good deal more merciful, I am
sure.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Talbot.</i> Anything you do is sure to be
right, Miss Vaughn. If you can put up with me,
I am sure I can afford to overlook any mistakes
you make. I play whist so seldom that I am all
out of practice.</p>

<p><i>Miss V.</i> (<i>dealing</i>). Oh, I just never play, only
when I have to make up the table. I have so
many things on hand. Why weren&rsquo;t you at the
Wentworths&rsquo; last night, Mr. Talbot?</p>

<p><i>Mr. T.</i> I was out of town. I think you gave
yourself two cards that time.</p>

<p><i>Miss V.</i> Oh, dear! Have I made a misdeal?
I wish you&rsquo;d count your cards.</p>

<p><i>Colonel G.</i> You are right. The next card is
mine.</p>

<p><i>Miss V.</i> Thank you.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. V.</i> That came out all right.</p>

<p><i>Colonel G.</i> But the trump is not turned.</p>

<p><i>Miss V.</i> Oh, which was the last card? I am
sure I don&rsquo;t know; I&rsquo;ve got them all mixed up
now.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. V.</i> Well, never mind. Let me draw one.
That will do just as well.</p>

<p><i>Mr. T.</i> Diamonds? Can&rsquo;t you draw again? I
haven&rsquo;t&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Miss V.</i> I don&rsquo;t think it was diamonds. I am
almost sure it was spades.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. V.</i> No, diamonds suits me, and of course
you can&rsquo;t change it now; can she, Colonel Graham?</p>

<p><i>Colonel G.</i> It isn&rsquo;t customary, I believe, unless
we are to play Auction Pitch, and bid for the trump.</p>

<p><i>Miss V.</i> Oh, now you are going to be sarcastic!
I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s fair.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. V.</i> Do you put your trumps at one end of
your hand, Colonel Graham?</p>

<p><i>Colonel G.</i> No, I do not, but some people find
it a convenience.</p>

<p><i>Mr. T.</i> Is it my lead?</p>

<p><i>Colonel G.</i> No, it is my partner&rsquo;s.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. V.</i> Oh, is it my lead? I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t
know what to play. You always lead from your
long suit, don&rsquo;t you? There, I hope that queen
will be good.</p>

<p><i>Mr. T.</i> No, it won&rsquo;t, for I have the ace.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. V.</i> Oh, you mean man! Partner, can&rsquo;t
you trump that?</p>

<p><i>Colonel G.</i> I have suit.</p>

<p><i>Miss V.</i> There, I have got to put the king on,
and I think it is mean.</p>

<p><i>Mr. T.</i> I am awfully sorry. If I&rsquo;d only known&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Miss V.</i> I shook my head at you, but you
wouldn&rsquo;t look up.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. V.</i> That wasn&rsquo;t fair, and you deserve to
be beaten. Now my jack is good, any way.</p>

<p><i>Mr. T.</i> It isn&rsquo;t your lead. I took the trick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mrs. V.</i> Oh, I beg pardon.</p>

<p><i>Miss V.</i> I would have trumped it, any way.</p>

<p><i>Mr. T.</i> I wish I knew what you have.</p>

<p><i>Miss V.</i> I wish I could tell you. Don&rsquo;t make
it too dark.</p>

<p><i>Mr. T.</i> Then I&rsquo;ll lead diamonds.</p>

<p><i>Miss V.</i> That&rsquo;s just right.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. V.</i> Diamonds are trumps.</p>

<p><i>Miss V.</i> Oh, are they? Oh, that&rsquo;s too bad.
I didn&rsquo;t want trumps led.</p>

<p><i>Mr. T.</i> But you said&mdash; Why, can&rsquo;t you go
over Colonel Graham&rsquo;s nine-spot?</p>

<p><i>Miss V.</i> I made a mistake. I meant to play
the ten.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. V.</i> Shall I put on a small one or a high
one, Colonel Graham?</p>

<p><i>Colonel G.</i> The trick is ours as it lies.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. V.</i> Then if I put on a high one it will get it
out of the way, so you&rsquo;ll know what to do next time.</p>

<p><i>Mr. T.</i> Why, you&rsquo;ve thrown away the king of
trumps!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. V.</i> Wasn&rsquo;t that right?</p>

<p><i>Miss V.</i> Why, of course not, mamma. You
ought to have put on either the ace or a low one.</p>

<p><i>Colonel G.</i> It is your lead, Mrs. Vaughn.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. V.</i> She says she&rsquo;ll trump hearts, and I
can&rsquo;t play my knave. I&rsquo;ll try spades. I hope
you&rsquo;ll take it.</p>

<p><i>Mr. T.</i> And he did. How nice to have a partner
do just what you tell him to.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Miss V.</i> That means that I don&rsquo;t.</p>

<p><i>Mr. T.</i> You are always satisfactory, whatever
you do.</p>

<p><i>Miss V.</i> What was led? Clubs? Are clubs
trumps?</p>

<p><i>Colonel G.</i> No; diamonds.</p>

<p><i>Miss V.</i> Second hand low. I know that, at any
rate, so there&rsquo;s a two-spot.</p>

<p><i>Mr. T.</i> Your mother has taken it with the
seven.</p>

<p><i>Miss V.</i> Oh, and I had the ace, king, and queen.
Ought I to have played one of those?</p>

<p><i>Colonel G.</i> If you tell us your hand you must
expect us to play to it.</p>

<p><i>Miss V.</i> I didn&rsquo;t mean to tell.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. V.</i> (<i>leading spades</i>). That was your suit,
wasn&rsquo;t it?</p>

<p><i>Mr. T.</i> But I hold the ace.</p>

<p><i>Miss V.</i> It was your own lead, mamma. Any
way, I&rsquo;ll trump it.</p>

<p><i>Mr. T.</i> Why, you&rsquo;ve trumped my ace.</p>

<p><i>Miss V.</i> Oh, did I? I didn&rsquo;t mean to. Can&rsquo;t
I take it back?</p>

<p><i>Colonel G.</i> It is a little late, but still&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Miss V.</i> Oh, well, never mind. Let it go. I
have the king, any way (<i>leading it</i>).</p>

<p><i>Colonel G.</i> But you just trumped a spade.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. V.</i> A revoke! That gives us three points.</p>

<p><i>Miss V.</i> Oh, it doesn&rsquo;t either! I didn&rsquo;t see
that king at all when I trumped, and that was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
only spade I had. I&rsquo;ll change it on the last trick,
and then it will be all right.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. V.</i> You can&rsquo;t do that; can she, Colonel
Graham?</p>

<p><i>Colonel G.</i> It isn&rsquo;t customary.</p>

<p><i>Mr. T.</i> Oh, who wants to play the stiff club
rules? I don&rsquo;t; there isn&rsquo;t any fun in whist if
you are going to be so particular.</p>

<p><i>Miss V.</i> Whose lead is it now?</p>

<p><i>Colonel G.</i> If it isn&rsquo;t yours it must be Mr.
Talbot&rsquo;s, as you decide about that trick.</p>

<p><i>Mr. T.</i> Then I&rsquo;ll lead a spade, and you can
trump it.</p>

<p><i>Miss V.</i> There, that&rsquo;s better than having that
trump wasted on your ace.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. V.</i> Did you ever play Stop? We played
it last summer at Bar Harbor. It&rsquo;s a Western
game, and you have chips, just like poker; and
then you stop it if you have the stop cards; and
sometimes you&rsquo;ll have the meanest little cards left
in your hands, and if it is the ace of diamonds you
have to pay five chips for it, or the king, or the
queen, or the knave, or the ten; not so much, of
course, but it all counts up awfully fast.</p>

<p><i>Mr. T.</i> Why, that is ever so much like Sixty-six.
Do you remember the time we tried to play Sixty-six
on the Bar Harbor boat, Miss Vaughn?</p>

<p><i>Miss V.</i> Oh, yes; and Ethel Mott <em>was</em> such
fun. She just would cheat, and there was no stopping
her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Colonel G.</i> It is your lead, Miss Vaughn.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. V.</i> Oh, just wait a moment. I want to
know if fourth best has anything to do with playing
fourth hand?</p>

<p><i>Colonel G.</i> Nothing whatever.</p>

<p><i>Mr. T.</i> Oh, fourth best is one of those things
they&rsquo;ve put in to make whist scientific. For my
part, I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any fun&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Miss V.</i> That&rsquo;s just what I say. When I play
whist I want to have a good time, and not feel as
if I were going through an examination at a scientific
school. Oh, did you know we are going to
have a whist figure at Janet Graham&rsquo;s german, Mr.
Talbot? Won&rsquo;t that be fun?</p>

<p><i>Mr. T.</i> I am sure then that you&rsquo;ll be trump.</p>

<p><i>Miss V.</i> Thank you.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. V.</i> How pretty!</p>

<p><i>Colonel G.</i> It is your lead, Miss Vaughn.</p>

<p><i>Miss V.</i> Why, did I take the last trick? What
shall I&mdash;oh, I know,&mdash;the ace of clubs.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. V.</i> The two-spot of diamonds ought to be
good for that.</p>

<p><i>Miss V.</i> How horrid! Now the rest of my
clubs aren&rsquo;t any good. Well, any way, I can throw
them away.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. V.</i> Have hearts been led?</p>

<p><i>Mr. T.</i> I&rsquo;m sure I can&rsquo;t remember.</p>

<p><i>Miss V.</i> (<i>examining tricks</i>). Yes, here&rsquo;s one
heart trick.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. V.</i> Well, I must lead it, and I&rsquo;m sure I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
don&rsquo;t remember about it at all. I&rsquo;ll lead a small
one. Was that right, Colonel Graham?</p>

<p><i>Colonel G.</i> You might have led your knave.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. V.</i> Why, how did you know I had the
knave. I declare, it&rsquo;s like witchcraft, the way you
keep run of the cards. I suppose you know where
every card is. Who took that?</p>

<p><i>Colonel G.</i> I did.</p>

<p><i>Mr. T.</i> I ought to have trumped that, but I do
hate to trump second hand.</p>

<p><i>Colonel G.</i> But you played suit.</p>

<p><i>Mr. T.</i> So I did. I forgot that.</p>

<p><i>Colonel G.</i> (<i>showing hand</i>). The rest of the
tricks are mine.</p>

<p><i>Miss V.</i> Why, I have the king and queen of
clubs, and you haven&rsquo;t a club in your hand.</p>

<p><i>Colonel G.</i> That is why the tricks are mine. I
can keep the lead to the end. I am very sorry,
Mrs. Vaughn; but I am suddenly attacked with a
nervous headache, so that I cannot possibly go on
playing. I shall have to ask to be excused.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. V.</i> Oh, don&rsquo;t break up the game when we
are getting along so well.</p>

<p><i>Colonel G.</i> I am very sorry; but I must go. I
have enjoyed the game extremely.</p>

<p><i>Mr. T.</i> Are you out?</p>

<p><i>Colonel G.</i> Yes.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. V.</i> I&rsquo;m sure it was all owing to you.</p>

<p><i>Colonel G.</i> It was all owing to the fall of the
cards. I haven&rsquo;t done anything.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Miss V.</i> I&rsquo;m sure we didn&rsquo;t have anything on
our side at all. I hate whist anyway; you have
to be so quiet, and study on it so.</p>

<p><i>Mr. T.</i> Yes, I think it&rsquo;s awfully hard work.</p>

<p><i>Colonel G.</i> Oh, you&rsquo;ll have better luck next
time. Good-by; don&rsquo;t rise.</p>

<p>[<i>And the Colonel goes to the club to relieve his
mind by a quantity of vigorous expletives, and then
to settle down to an evening of what he calls real
whist.</i>]</p>

more than that, I was christened Betty,&mdash;plain
Betty,&mdash;and Betty I will be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Betty, then, if that suits you;
though why you should be so particular
about that old-fashioned name, I&rsquo;m sure I
can&rsquo;t conceive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the first place, it is my name,&rdquo; Betty
replied, bending upon him a glance at once
bewitching and tantalizing; &ldquo;that ought to
count for something; and in the second
place, my family name isn&rsquo;t one that lends
itself to soft prefixes. Besides all which,
there has been a Betty Mork from time immemorial;
and I shall never be one to spoil
the line by changing my name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Mr. Granton demanded mischievously.
&ldquo;Never change it? Are you
vowed to eternal single blessedness, then, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
shall you imitate the women&rsquo;s-rights women,
who&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is really none of your affair what I intend
to do,&rdquo; returned she, bridling; &ldquo;only, to go
back to what we started on, I do intend to play
in the tournament with Frank Bradford. I am
not in the habit of breaking my promises.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The pair walked along the shady country
road without speaking for a moment or two,
the young man inclined to be sulky, his companion
saucy and good-natured. The dropping
sunshine, falling through the gently
waving elm-boughs, struck golden lights out
of Miss Mork&rsquo;s abundant chestnut hair,&mdash;her
one beauty, it amused her to call it, although
the smile which brought out her dimples and
the lustre of her eyes contradicted the words
even while they were being spoken. Young
Granton was fully alive to the attractiveness
of the lithe figure beside him; indeed, for his
own peace of mind, far too keenly. He was
aware, too, of the difficulty of managing the
wilful beauty, whose independence was sufficiently
understood by all the summer idlers
at Maugus.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you certainly knew I expected you
to play in the tournament with me,&rdquo; he began
again, returning to the attack.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t modest for a girl ever to know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
what a man expects of her until she&rsquo;s told,&rdquo;
Betty replied demurely, &ldquo;even in tennis.
And besides, it was presumptuous for you to
be so royally certain of my acquiescence in
whatever you deigned to plan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll serve a cut so that you&rsquo;ll never be
able to return it,&rdquo; threatened he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can serve a cut myself,&rdquo; she retorted,
with an accent which seemed to indicate a
double significance in the words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Confound it!&rdquo; he said, incisively, with
sudden and inconsistent change of base, &ldquo;it
is perfect folly letting ladies into a tournament
anyway. Who wants them? They
always make trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I understood that you wanted one,&rdquo; Betty
answered, unmoved, observing the fringe of
her parasol with great apparent interest;
&ldquo;but of course I knew your invitation was not
to be taken too seriously.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, bother!&rdquo; the young man cried, slashing
viciously at the head of a late-blooming
daisy. &ldquo;Why do you always insist on quarrelling
with me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are we really quarrelling?&rdquo; she laughed
back with her most exasperating lightness of
manner. &ldquo;How delightful! If there is one
thing that I enjoy more than I do tennis, it is
a good quarrel.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Tennis!&rdquo; Granton retorted, the last
shreds of his patience giving way. &ldquo;It must
be allowed that you can quarrel better than
you can play. No girl,&rdquo; he went on, with increasing
acerbity, &ldquo;can ever really play tennis:
she only plays at playing it; and it
spoils any man&rsquo;s game to play with her. For
my part, I cannot see why they are to be
admitted to the tournament at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Merci!</i>&rdquo; exclaimed Mistress Betty, stopping
in the sun-dappled way to make him
a profound courtesy. &ldquo;Now I know what
your true sentiments are, and how much
your invitation was worth. Thank you for
nothing, Mr. Nat Granton. I wish you luck
of your partner,&mdash;when you get one. It is
a cruel shame that by the rules of the tournament
it must be a girl!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And before Granton was able to reply or
knew what she intended, pretty Miss Mork,
with her tripping gait, her bright eyes, ugly
name, and all, had whisked through a turnstile
and was half-way across the lawn of
the cottage where her particular bosom-friend
Miss Dora Mosely was spending the
summer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">While</span> Granton continued his perturbed
way down the lovely village street to the Elm
House, which for the time being was the
home of a pleasant colony of summer idlers
seeking rest and diversion in Maugus, Miss
Betty flitted lightly over the lawn and joined
her friend, whom she found reposing in a
hammock swung under the cool veranda.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Dolly,&rdquo; was her breathless salutation,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got the awfullest thing to do! But I&rsquo;ll
do it, or perish in the attempt!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Halloo, Betty!&rdquo; was Miss Mosely&rsquo;s response
and greeting; &ldquo;how like a whirlwind
you are! What is the matter? What have
you got to do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Beat Mr. Granton at tennis in the tournament.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You and Mr. Bradford, you mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; I mean all by myself,&mdash;in a single.
I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t play in the double at all, if I can
get out of it without sneaking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What in the world has happened to bring
you to this desperate frame of mind?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Dolly, the fact is, Mr. Granton has
been making himself particularly odious because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
I wouldn&rsquo;t throw over Frank Bradford
to play with him, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told you,&rdquo; her friend interrupted judicially,
examining the toe of her slipper with
much interest and satisfaction, &ldquo;that you&rsquo;d
be sorry you agreed to play with Frank.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not sorry,&rdquo; protested the other,
with spirit. &ldquo;Do you think I&rsquo;m so bound
up in Nat Granton that I can&rsquo;t get on without
him? If he wanted me to play with him
why didn&rsquo;t he ask me, instead of taking it
for granted, in that insufferably conceited
way of his, that I&rsquo;d stand about and wait on
his lordship&rsquo;s leisure? Oh, I&rsquo;ll pay him off!
I shall go over to grandmother&rsquo;s every
blessed day from now until the tournament
and practise, so as to take down his top-loftical
airs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At which exhibition of spite and determination
Miss Mosely fell to laughing, and said
Betty&rsquo;s manner suggested pickled limes,
which in turn reminded her of the chocolate-creams
they had at boarding-school, and that
brought to mind some particularly delicious
marshmallows which had been saved until
Betty should come over; and she added that
it would be a very good plan to go into the
house and devour them.</p>

<p>Over the flabby and inane confection with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
which the two friends regaled themselves, it
was arranged that Dora should devote herself
with Machiavelian shrewdness to bringing
about a reconciliation between Frank Bradford
and his betrothed, Flora Sturtevant,
whose quarrel had led to the invitation which
had involved Betty in her present difficulties.
In the meantime, Mistress Mork was to give
herself with great assiduity to the practice
of cutting, volleying, and such devices of skill
or cunning as would make possible the realization
of her bold plan of conquering Mr.
Granton in the tennis tournament, over which
all the young people were just then much
excited.</p>

<p>These conclusions were not reached without
much digression, circumlocution, and irrelevant
discourse upon various matters, with
a good deal of consideration of the dress
which would be both convenient and becoming
for the important games.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have almost a mind to try a divided
skirt,&rdquo; Betty said thoughtfully. &ldquo;George
saw one at a tournament in England, and it
could be fixed so as not&mdash; Oh, Dora, if
George were only here! He knows all the
new English rules and cuts, and all sorts of
quirks. Oh, why did you have to quarrel
with him just now? Now I shall lose my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
tennis just because you drove him away from
Maugus.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Betty Mork! You said yourself
you wouldn&rsquo;t stand his lordly ways; you
know you did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; returned her friend illogically;
&ldquo;but we both agreed that you&rsquo;d have
to make up with him some time; and I
didn&rsquo;t know then that I should want him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what could I do?&rdquo; demanded Dora,
divided between a sense of being deserted by
her friend and a desire to have difficulties
smoothed over. &ldquo;Any girl with decent pride
would have <em>had</em> to send George away. You
know how I hated to do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you might send for him now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I couldn&rsquo;t. That would be too awfully
humiliating. I wonder you can propose
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Men are so dreadful,&rdquo; sighed Betty.</p>

<p>The two forlorn victims of masculine perversity
pensively ate marshmallows in silence
for a moment, revolving, no doubt, the most
profound reflections upon the vanity of
human affairs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what I will do,&rdquo; Betty said at
length, reflectively. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll write to George
and make him visit grandmother. He hasn&rsquo;t
been there for a year, to stay; and, as grandmother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
says, she &lsquo;admires to have him.&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll
tell him if he&rsquo;ll stay there, out of sight, I
think I can fix things with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you delicious, darling hypocrite!&rdquo;
exclaimed her friend, embracing her rapturously.
&ldquo;You are a perfect treasure, Bet! I&rsquo;ll
do anything to help you,&mdash;anything. I&rsquo;ve
been perfectly wretched ever since George
went away; but of course I couldn&rsquo;t say so,
if I&rsquo;d died.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">So</span> you are not going to play with Bradford,
after all?&rdquo; Nat Granton said, flinging
himself on the turf at Miss Mork&rsquo;s feet as she
sat watching the tennis-players practising for
the tournament.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;He and Flora have
recovered from their temporary alienation,
and I was generous and took myself out of
the way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you play with me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you; no. I shall not go into any
team; and in any case, I know too well your
sentiments on the subject of girls&rsquo; playing to
trespass on your good nature.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I shall not play,&rdquo; he said, rather
crossly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And pray what do I care if you don&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It would be polite to pretend to, at any
rate.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0a">&ldquo;&lsquo;The slightest approach to a false pretence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was never among my crimes;&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noi">she quoted, twirling her gay parasol swiftly
on its handle. &ldquo;Do see Tom Carruth serve.
That cut is my despair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is simple enough to return,&rdquo; Granton
answered, &ldquo;if you know when it is coming:
you&rsquo;ve only to run up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but how is one to know when it is
coming?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One always can tell when I give it,&rdquo; he replied,
laughing, &ldquo;for I always fling my head
back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There came a wicked sparkle of intelligence
into Betty&rsquo;s eyes as she made a
mental note of this confession for future use.
Then the long lashes fell demurely over her
cheeks as she gathered together her belongings
and rose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must go over to grandmother&rsquo;s,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;Never spend the summer near your
grandmother&rsquo;s, Mr. Granton: she may be ill
and absorb all your spare time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And away sped the deceitful damsel, on
nefarious schemes intent, to play tennis with
her cousin George, who had responded with
celerity to her summons. She was really improving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
with a good deal of rapidity. She
had been a sad romp in her day, and every
prank of her tomboy girlhood stood her in
good stead now. Every fence and tree she
had climbed, to the unspeakable horror and
scandal of elderly spinster aunts, every game
of ball for which she had been lectured by
an eminently proper governess, every stolen
fishing-expedition and hoydenish race whose
improprieties my lady buried with overwhelming
scorn in the oblivion of the past,
had been a preparation for the struggle into
which she now threw herself with the whole
force of mind and body.</p>

<p>Her cousin George Snow, who was sufficiently
fond of his mischievous cousin, and
duly grateful for her supposed good offices
in arranging the difficulties between himself
and Dora, was an invaluable ally. He was
taken into full confidence, and embraced the
project most heartily. Granton was a right
nice fellow, he admitted, but it certainly would
not hurt him to be taken down a peg. Snow
had just returned from England, where he had
seen some of the finest tennis-players perform.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You play too near the net,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;All American players do. Play well back,
and above everything, put all your force
into the return.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But I shall send the ball out of the court,&rdquo;
Betty protested.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t. Drive it down as hard as
ever you can. Strength&mdash;or rather swiftness&mdash;tells;
if your service is swift enough it is
worth all the fancy cuts in the world. The
Renshaws make half their points by volleying
from the service-line, and the rest by
swift service.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Swiftness is the word,&rdquo; Betty returned
gayly. &ldquo;Anything more?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get used to striking back-handed; don&rsquo;t
try to turn your thumb down; make a business
of an out-and-out back-handed, wrong-side-of-the-racquet
stroke.&rdquo;</p>

<p>How sound all this advice was, tennis players
may determine for themselves; but it certainly
served its purpose well. Betty was a
promising pupil. Morning, noon, and night
she played, working with an assiduity which
nearly fagged her cousin out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are plucky, Betty,&rdquo; he declared one
day. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid for my own laurels. And
by the way, am I to be allowed to be present
at this great tournament in which you are to
cover yourself and your sex with glory?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes; you are to challenge Mr. Granton
if he beats me,&mdash;though he sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t!
Anybody can challenge the winner, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
know. That&rsquo;s a provision I had put in myself
to cover my own case.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor Granton!&rdquo; George laughed. &ldquo;Little
does he dream of the awful humiliation in
store for him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Betty set her lips together and nodded her
head in a determined way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;George,&rdquo; she declared, with tragic earnestness,
&ldquo;if I get beaten I shall go straight
home and die of&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Baffled stubbornness,&rdquo; interpolated her
cousin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thwarted vengeance,&rdquo; suggested Dora.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, of righteous indignation. Come, one
set more before we drive back to Maugus.
Only two days left, you know.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>IV.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> morning of the second day of the
tournament dawned clear, and what was quite
as much to the purpose, unusually cool. A
little breeze from the northwest crept over
the hills,&mdash;just enough to fan the heated
players without disturbing the flight of the
balls; while to make the weather perfect for
tennis, by ten o&rsquo;clock a light veil of clouds
had comfortably covered the sun, cutting off
all troublesome rays.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a perfect day,&rdquo; Betty remarked to
Dora, as they took their places among the
spectators. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve put my things ready so I
can dress in two minutes. Here comes
George.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The affair was an event in quiet Maugus.
It had been talked about as the most important
event could not have been discussed
anywhere but in the idle hours of summer
leisure, and had come to be regarded as
quite the event of the season. The tennis-court
was laid out near the Elm House, and
was surrounded by superb old trees that in
all the slow years of their growth had never
over-arched a prettier sight than that afternoon
showed, with its groups of nice old
ladies, and charming young damsels in all the
picturesque bravery of their nineteenth-century
costume. The contest of the first day
of the tournament had disposed of all the
four-handed games but the final match, and
the afternoon of the second day was left free
for the single games. Granton had entered
for the latter, and was looked upon as the
probable victor. He won easily his first rubber,
and came over to where Betty sat to
wait his turn again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is lucky for me, Mr. Snow,&rdquo; he said to
George, who in the happiness of full reconciliation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
sat by Dora&rsquo;s side, &ldquo;that you are not
playing, or I shouldn&rsquo;t have the ghost of a
chance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m resting on the laurels I won last
year,&rdquo; was the light response. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s far easier
than to risk one&rsquo;s reputation and defend it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you so sure of winning, as it is, Mr.
Granton?&rdquo; asked Betty coolly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure? Of course not; but I have hopes
now, which I shouldn&rsquo;t indulge if Mr. Snow,
with the glory of his victories at Newport
last year, were counted in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish you success,&rdquo; she said, with a certain
trace of satire in her tone. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t Mr. Howard
playing remarkably well to-day? What a
splendid volley? That gives him the game.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sets: two, love,&rdquo; called the scorer, and
Mr. Howard&rsquo;s victory was saluted with applause,
which Mistress Betty took great satisfaction
in leading.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You seem to be greatly pleased at Howard&rsquo;s
good luck,&rdquo; Granton observed, remembering
that when his success had been
clapped, just before, Miss Mork had refrained
from lending a hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t I be?&rdquo; she returned.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve bet him a pair of gloves he wins.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What will you bet me I lose?&rdquo; demanded
he, not especially pleased at any sort of understanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
between the young lady before
him and Howard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anything you like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should like nothing so much as&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; upon reflection I don&rsquo;t think I dare
mention it,&rdquo; Granton said coolly, looking at
her with an expression in his big brown eyes
which made her flush in spite of herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be impudent,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;That
is my province.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Time!&rdquo; called the umpire, a little later.
&ldquo;Howard and Granton, concluding set.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wish me luck,&rdquo; Granton murmured, bending
toward Betty as he rose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I do, for my own sake,&rdquo; she responded,
with an ambiguity he afterward had
reason to understand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What shall I do if Mr. Howard beats
him?&rdquo; Betty said to George and Dora, as
the set began. &ldquo;There&rsquo;d be no fun playing
him instead of Mr. Granton.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Howard hasn&rsquo;t the ghost of a
chance,&rdquo; George responded reassuringly.
&ldquo;You are all right, Bet, if you don&rsquo;t get
nervous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Betty did get nervous. The color came
and went in her cheeks almost as swiftly as
the flying balls were thrown, whose skilful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
service and returns soon proved Snow to be
right in asserting that Howard had no chance
against his antagonist.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, George,&rdquo; she whispered, in an agony
of apprehension, &ldquo;can I do it? Won&rsquo;t he
beat me? It would be too horrible to challenge
him and then fail!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do it?&rdquo; retorted her cousin; &ldquo;of course
you can do it! See that short serve. That&rsquo;s
what&rsquo;s breaking Howard up: it&rsquo;s easy for
you to return if you&rsquo;ll run up to it. His
swift service doesn&rsquo;t begin to be as good
as yours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Love set,&rdquo; called the scorer; and as Betty
looked at the supple, muscular figure of Nat
Granton while the players exchanged courts,
her fears almost overcame her resolve.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My heart is thumping against my very
boot-heels, Dolly,&rdquo; she confided to her friend.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no sort of use.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you going to give up?&rdquo; demanded
Dora curiously, and perhaps a little tauntingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give up!&rdquo; cried Mistress Mork stoutly.
&ldquo;Do I ever give up? I&rsquo;ll die first! But I
do wish he wouldn&rsquo;t get so many love
games! It&rsquo;s dreadfully discouraging.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Granton was, in truth, having everything
his own way. Howard, although a good
player, had somehow lost his coolness, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
was soon demoralized by a peculiar short,
cutting service, of which his opponent had
complete mastery, and which he was unable
to return. His play became wild and uneven,
and the contest was quickly decided
against him.</p>

<p>The master of ceremonies came forward
with the announcement that the prize racquet
belonged to Mr. Nathaniel Granton, but
that, according to the provisions of the tournament,
any person had now a right to challenge
the winner to play for the prize, by the
best two games in three.</p>

<p>There was a rustle, and then a pause, as
many eyes were turned toward George Snow,
who had won in the Newport games the
summer before. But that gentleman sat
quiet in his place, a smile of amusement
stealing over his comely features as Dora
said, in the most tragic of whispers,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Betty, how can you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Betty, her head thrown a trifle back,
and the color flaming hotly into her face,
rose with a charming mixture of dignity
and shyness, and walked, before them all,
straight up to the judges.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I challenge the winner to a match,&rdquo; she
said, steadily enough, although she confided
to Dora afterward that she felt as if every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
word had to be dragged out by main force.
&ldquo;I should like five minutes to change my
dress.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Granton uttered a low, sharp whistle, and
doffed his cap.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; the master of ceremonies
returned. &ldquo;Be as quick as you can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not keep you waiting long,&rdquo; she assured
him, and turned to beckon Dora to her.</p>

<p>As the two girls disappeared into the
hotel, the bustle and chatter began again
with renewed vigor, and swelled and buzzed
in the liveliest fashion. Here was a genuine
sensation for Maugus. Betty was too lovely
and too great a favorite with the men wholly
to escape the censure of the young ladies,
who now had a string of pretty things to say
of her boldness and presumption. But the
gentlemen rallied to a man in her support,
and, by the time she reappeared, public
opinion, as represented by the spectators of
the tournament, if not wholly in her favor,
was so in outward expression.</p>

<p>She was dressed in a dark-blue jersey of
silk, which fitted her in that perfect combination
only possible with a faultless figure
and an irreproachable jersey; and below
that a skirt of navy-blue flannel fell in
straight plaits to her ankles, where one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
caught, as she moved, occasional glimpses
of a crimson stocking, the exact shade of
her flat sash and of the close wing-tip in her
trig little blue silk cap. There was nothing
of the nature of tags and ends about her
costume. Her hair was closely coiled, and
even her ear-rings had been removed. The
crimson handkerchief about her white throat
was fastened into its place so securely as
scarcely to be less smooth when the playing
was over than when the first game began.</p>

<p>She was very sober,&mdash;so grave, indeed,
that George went over to her just as she
took her place, to say some absurd thing to
make her laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be nervous,&rdquo; he added, having
succeeded in his object so far as to call a
fleeting smile to her face. &ldquo;And don&rsquo;t
look as if assisting at your own obsequies.
You are all right, if you&rsquo;ll only think so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will she do it?&rdquo; Dora asked anxiously,
as he took his seat again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he answered.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told her she will, and I hope so; but
it isn&rsquo;t going to be so easy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They talked of that tennis tournament for
many a long day in Maugus. Opinion was
divided at first as to the probable result.
There was a quiet concentration in Betty&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
manner which soon began to awake confidence
in her ultimate success, although at
first she lost. Even the most envious of the
girls soon found themselves applauding every
lucky hit she made; and Betty, whose senses
were keenly alive that day, felt the stimulating
consciousness that the general sympathy
was with her. She threw her whole
soul into her playing, every point she lost
arousing her to new exertions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By Jove! Dora,&rdquo; George said, &ldquo;Granton&rsquo;s
bound to get a lesson. Betty&rsquo;s blood
is getting up. I&rsquo;m convinced now that she&rsquo;ll
win, and I&rsquo;ll bet you the gloves that she
beats him a love set before she&rsquo;s done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dora was too excited to answer him. She
hoped he might be right, but just now Betty
was losing. She had been beaten three
games out of five, and the present one, on
Granton&rsquo;s service, was going hard against
her. Granton was harassing her with his
short cut, which fell before her racquet
reached it nearly every time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s got into her?&rdquo; George muttered
uneasily. &ldquo;Ah, that was better. Good
return.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And he led the hand-clapping which
greeted the difficult stroke by which Betty
brought the score up to deuce. The game<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
went against her, however, and soon after,
the set.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it, George,&rdquo; Betty said under her
breath, as she passed him in changing courts.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be discouraged. The Mork blood
is up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all on his cuts, Bet. Run up to them.
Watch his service, and you can tell when
they are coming. Nat could never serve a
decent swift ball.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Betty nodded and went on to her place.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Play!&rdquo; called Granton.</p>

<p>Watching him, his opponent noticed him
throw his head back, and remembered his
telling her that he always betrayed his cutting.
She ran toward the net as the ball
came down, and returned it like a cannonball.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s got it!&rdquo; cried Snow, with great
glee, in his excitement calling so loudly that
both the players heard him. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s all
right now. Oh, that&rsquo;s beautiful!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Granton tried a couple of swift balls and
faulted them both.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Love; thirty,&rdquo; called the scorer.</p>

<p>Another cut; again cleverly intercepted;
then a fault and an easy, round-hand service.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Love; game.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The applause was really quite tremendous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;They are all against me,&rdquo; Granton observed
to Betty, handing her the balls
over the net and laughing rather ruefully.
&ldquo;Public opinion would be positively outraged
if you should fail.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no intention of failing, thank you,&rdquo;
she returned, with spirit; and away she
swept to her position. &ldquo;Play!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Granton was himself on his mettle, yet he
did not play his best. He could not fully
recover from his surprise at the style of his
adversary&rsquo;s play. The swiftness of her service
and returns was so different from what
was expected of a girl that he was scarcely
on his guard against it up to the very end.
He felt the sympathy of the spectators, too,
to be against him, and this was not without
its influence. He lost the set, and with it,
by an unfortunate chance, his good nature.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sets, one all,&rdquo; the scorer announced;
and something in the saucy toss of Betty&rsquo;s
lovely head, as, flushed and panting, she
stood talking with George and Dora, jarred
upon her lover&rsquo;s nerves with sudden irritation.
An unreasonable madness took possession
of him. How much was wounded vanity,
it might not be easy to say; but under the
circumstances, with all his mates grinning
at his failure, it was not at all strange that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
his feelings were not wholly placid. His
play in the third and decisive set became
rash and excited. He lost his head a little,
and before he fairly knew how it happened
the score was called on Betty&rsquo;s service:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Games; five, love&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; was George Snow&rsquo;s comment.
&ldquo;I told you she&rsquo;d beat a love set before
she was done.&mdash;Oh, keep your head, Bet!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Betty delivered a ball swift as a bullet
and just clearing the net.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fifteen; love.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A fault, and then another swift ball, which
skimmed like a swallow over the net and
struck the ground only to cling to it in a
swift roll.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thirty; love.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next ball was beaten back and forth
until Granton dashed it to the ground at
Betty&rsquo;s very feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thirty; fifteen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The excitement was at its height. Even
those who did not appreciate the finer points
of the play caught the interest and somehow
understood pretty accurately how matters
stood, and were as earnest as the rest.
Small-talk was forgotten, heads were craned
forward, and all eyes were fixed upon the
players. Betty grasped her racquet by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
the extreme end of its handle, and held the
ball as high above her head as she could
reach.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Play!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She struck it with all her force.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forty; fifteen,&rdquo; was the scorer&rsquo;s call; and
Nat Granton understood that only one stroke
lay between him and defeat by a love set.</p>

<p>George Snow deliberately turned away his
face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never supposed I could be such a consummate
fool,&rdquo; he said afterward, &ldquo;but I
positively could not look at your last service,
Bet. I felt as if the whole universe were at
stake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As for the player, she was fairly pale with
excitement; but her head was clear and her
hand steady. She paused an instant, poising
her racquet. She observed that Granton
stood near the middle of his court. With a
quick step she moved to the very outer corner
of her own and sent a swift ball sharply
under her opponent&rsquo;s left hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Game; love set,&rdquo; called the scorer.
&ldquo;Sets two to one in favor of Miss Mork.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And, amid what for Maugus was a really
astonishing round of applause, Betty, flushed
but triumphant, walked to the net to shake
hands with her vanquished lover.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>


<h3>V.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was astonishing how humble and forgiving
her victory made Mistress Betty. She
was troubled with the fear that she had been
unmaidenly, that she had hurt Granton&rsquo;s feelings
and alienated his friendship forever, with
a dozen more scruples quite as absurd and
irrational.</p>

<p>She escaped as quickly as possible from
her friends and their congratulations, and
hurried to her room on the pretext of dressing
for supper. There she cooled her hot
cheeks, burning with exercise and excitement,
and looking ruefully at her image in the
mirror, shook her head reproachfully at the
counterfeit presentment as at one who had
beguiled her into misdoing.</p>

<p>After supper she was sitting rather gloomily
in a retired corner of the piazza, when the
defeated Granton approached. The reaction
from the afternoon&rsquo;s excitement had rendered
the young lady&rsquo;s spirit rather subdued, but
she rallied at sight of the new-comer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-evening,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Were you enjoying
the sweets of victory?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was enjoying the sweets of solitude,&rdquo;
she returned, a little pointedly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>Granton laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; he remarked, taking a vacant
chair near her, &ldquo;that I need not apologize for
my ill-judged remarks some time since about
girls and tennis. My afternoon&rsquo;s punishment
ought to pass as a sufficient expiation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Expiation is always a matter of feeling.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, as to that, I felt I had enough, I
assure you,&rdquo; he laughed. &ldquo;It may not be
gallant to say so, but it was really horrible to
be beaten out of my boots by a lady in broad
daylight, in face of all Maugus assembled.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Betty was silent. The remorseful feeling
rose again in her breast. Granton spoke
lightly enough, but she wondered if she had
not humiliated him terribly. She played
nervously with her fan, hardly knowing how
to phrase it, yet longing to offer something
in the way of apology.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; she began, &ldquo;I hope&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nat regarded her closely in the fading light
as she hesitated, and by some happy inspiration
divined her softened mood. He noted
the downcast eyes and troubled face. Without
fully comprehending her mental state, he
yet found courage to move a trifle nearer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; he queried, laying his fingers upon
the arm of her chair.</p>

<p>Betty looked at the hand which had approached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
so near, and a sudden trepidation
thrilled her. She opened and closed her fan
nervously, but made no attempt to finish her
broken sentence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Betty,&rdquo; her lover said, leaning forward,
&ldquo;now I am in the dust at your feet, you must
at least let me speak. You&rsquo;ve kept out of
my way so for the last two or three weeks
that I was afraid you disliked me; but now I
understand where you have been. You know
how much I care for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Still she did not raise her eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you care for me?&rdquo; he pleaded.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been in love with you all summer.
You must have known it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He paused again, yet she did not answer,
though a great tide of joy thrilled her whole
being. Her lover seized both her hands and
bent down until his cheek almost touched
hers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you marry me, Betty?&rdquo;</p>

<p>All her wilfulness and sauciness flashed in
her eyes as she lifted her glance at last to his
and answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t if I hadn&rsquo;t beaten this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With which implied consent he seemed
perfectly satisfied.</p>

MRS. FRUFFLES IS AT HOME.</h2>

<h2>MRS. FRUFFLES IS AT HOME.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> answer to the announcement that Mrs. Stephen
Morgan Fruffles will, on the afternoon of
January 27, be at home from four to seven, all the
world&mdash;with the exception of her husband, who
keeps significantly out of the house, and at his club
finds such solace as is possible under the circumstances&mdash;has
assembled to celebrate that rare and
exciting event.</p>

<p>The parlors are thronged almost to suffocation;
the air is warm, and laden with a hundred odors,
which combine to make it well-nigh unbreathable;
the constant babble of conversation goes on with
the steady click-clack of a mill-wheel, and several
hundred people persistently talk without saying
anything whatever.</p>

<p>Mrs. Chumley Jones is there, in a most effective,
costume of garnet plush, adorned with some sort
of long-haired black fur. She is conscious of being
perfectly well dressed, of being the best-known
woman in the parlors, and most of all is she now,
as always, conscious of being the one and only
Mrs. Chumley Jones. Soothed and sustained by
an unfaltering trust in all these good things, she
moves slowly through the rooms, or stands at some
convenient coign of vantage, dropping a word to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
this one and to that, with just the right differences
of manner fitted to the degrees of the people
whom she addresses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear Mrs. Fruffles,&rdquo; she remarks to the
hostess, &ldquo;you do always have such enchanting
receptions!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, thank you, dear Mrs. Jones,&rdquo; responds the
other, fully aware what is expected of her; &ldquo;I wish
I could begin to have anything so charming as
your Fridays.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, so kind of you to say so,&rdquo; murmurs Mrs.
Jones, with the expressive shake of the head proper
to the sentiment and the occasion.</p>

<p>Then she passes on to her duty elsewhere.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you do, Mrs. Jones?&rdquo; the voice of
Ferdinand Maunder says at her side. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it a
lovely day? It is really like a Roman winter;
don&rsquo;t you think so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it really is, Mr. Maunder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve been saying to myself all
day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is so much nicer of you to say it to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mrs. Jones, you are always so clever at
turning things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They smile at each other with perfect and well-bred
inanity for a second, and then Fred Lasceet
slips in between them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you do, Mrs. Jones?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, how do you do, Mr. Lasceet? It is ever
so long since I have seen you.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;So good of you to think it long. I am sure it
seems an age to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Maunder having meanwhile glided through
the crowd with an eel-like elusiveness, Mrs. Chumley
Jones is left with a remark upon which to form
her conversation for the afternoon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have had such a strange winter; don&rsquo;t you
think so, Mr. Lasceet? It is really like a Roman
winter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It really is; though I shouldn&rsquo;t have thought
of it. You are always so clever in thinking of
things, Mrs. Jones.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a sad flatterer, Mr. Lasceet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Lasceet endeavors to look very sly and cunning,
and while he gives his mind to this endeavor
another slips into his place.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you do, Mrs. Jones?&rdquo; says Percival
Drummond.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, how do you do, Mr. Drummond? I
haven&rsquo;t seen you for ever so long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Lasceet melts into the swaying background,
and is seen no more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It really is not nice of you to say so, Mrs.
Jones,&rdquo; is Mr. Drummond&rsquo;s response, &ldquo;when I
took you in to dinner at Mrs. Tiger&rsquo;s night before
last.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear me; how stupid of me! I really
fear I am losing my mind. It is the weather, I
think. It is so like a Roman winter, don&rsquo;t you
think?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is a little.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, ever so much. How do you do, dear
Mrs. Gray? I am delighted to see you. I was
just saying to Mr. Drummond that it seems to me
that our winter this year is so much like a Roman
winter. Did you ever think of it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, my dear, I have thought of nothing else
all winter. Why, it is just such a day as it was one
afternoon two years ago when I was in Rome.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Were you in Rome year before last?&rdquo; Mr.
Drummond inquires, with the air of one to whom
the answer of the question is of the most vital
importance, although he asks only for the sake of
being silent no longer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, we went in October and stayed until
March. You remember, Mrs. Jones, that we dined
with you the very day before we sailed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, so you did. I had forgotten all
about it. Are you going?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I really must go. I have three places
more to call before I go home, and we are going
out to dinner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall see you if you dine at the Muchmen&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, are you to be there? How lovely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope to take one of you in,&rdquo; Mr. Drummond
says, with a smile of the most brilliant
vacuity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you to be there, too? Why, it will be
quite a reunion. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Au revoir.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>The crowd swallows Mrs. Gray, and at the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
moment Mr. Drummond is seized upon by a sharp-looking
elderly female, who drags him off as if she
were conveying him into some sly corner where
she may devour him undisturbed. Mrs. Jones
turns to move toward the other parlor.</p>

<p>At that moment she is accosted by a lady of an
appearance so airy, both as regards dress and manner,
as to suggest that she is a mislaid member of
some ballet troupe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, how do you do?&rdquo; she cried, with a
vivacity quite in keeping with her appearance.
&ldquo;My dear Mrs. Jones, I haven&rsquo;t seen you since I
got back from Europe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Susie Throgmorton, is it really you? I
didn&rsquo;t know you were home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That shows what an unimportant person I
am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I knew you came home from Europe, but
I thought you were still in New York.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I only went on to see Aunt Dinah for a
couple of days. I got caught in the most awful
storm you ever saw.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the winter,&rdquo; Mrs. Chumley Jones observes,
with an air of freshness and conviction which is
something beautiful to see, &ldquo;has been as mild as
a Roman winter most of the time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it has been like a Roman winter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The crowd separates them and they go their
several ways, each repeating that it is like a Roman
winter; but meanwhile the same observation is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
being scattered broadcast by Mr. Maunder, Mr.
Lasceet, and Mr. Drummond, so that, although
there are a good many people in the room, they
are in a fair way of being all informed that the
winter strongly resembles that of Rome; a statement
which, if true, may be regarded as of the
highest importance.</p>

<p>It is not until, entering the tea room, Mrs.
Chumley Jones encounters Mrs. Quagget, who
talks more rapidly than any other known woman,
that she has anybody take the words out of her
mouth; but before she can tell Mrs. Quagget that
it is like a Roman winter, Mrs. Quagget has imparted
that interesting information to her. It is
all one, however, since something has been said
by one of them; and Mrs. Chumley Jones is not
in the least disconcerted. She still clings to the
convenient remark, as she did not take the trouble
to bring one with her, and this one suits her purpose
admirably.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear Miss Tarrart,&rdquo; she exclaims, as she
comes upon a wintry young lady of advanced stages
of maturity, &ldquo;how do you do? I haven&rsquo;t seen you
for an age.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, how do you do, Mrs. Jones?&rdquo; is the
response, delivered in a manner so emphatic as to
convey the impression that the reason why Miss
Tarrart is so odd-looking is because she has put so
much energy into her greetings of her friends.
&ldquo;I am enchanted to see you. When do you go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
abroad? I am sure one might almost think they
were abroad in this weather. It is so&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Mrs. Jones interposes, taking the words
out of her mouth; &ldquo;I was just saying to Mrs.
Quagget that this is really quite like a Roman
winter; don&rsquo;t you think so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is,&rdquo; Miss Tarrart answers, with the air
of one who has been beaten by unfair means. &ldquo;It
is like a Roman winter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you come and see me, Miss Tarrart?
It really is not kind of you to stay away so
long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am coming very soon; and you must come
and see me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes; I am coming. Do you know which
way Mrs. Fruffles is? I really must go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is in the other room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, good-bye, dear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two separate, each thinking how fast the
other is growing old. Mrs. Chumley Jones, feeling
that she has now done her whole duty, does not
even take the trouble any more to tell people that
the winter is like a Roman one. She merely
makes her way to the hostess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;One always has such
lovely times at your house, Mrs. Fruffles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it is so kind of you to say so, when your
Fridays are so much pleasanter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is so kind of you to say so, my dear Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
Fruffles; but I am sorry to say that I cannot agree
with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is the weather partly,&rdquo; the hostess observes;
&ldquo;so many people have said to me this afternoon
that it seems like a Roman winter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I was just thinking of that very thing.
Well, good-bye, my dear. Be sure and come in on
Friday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I wouldn&rsquo;t miss it for anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And as far as Mrs. Chumley Jones is concerned,
Mrs. Stephen Morgan Fruffles ceases to be &ldquo;At
Home.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>JOHN VANTINE.</h2>

<div class="figleft">

</div>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">The</span> relation of so improbable a story
as the following is to be justified
only by its truth. The hero is a
New York lawyer, sufficiently well
known to render the mention of his name,
were it allowable to give it, an ample guarantee
for the entire trustworthiness of any
statement he might make; and it is perhaps
to be regretted that his invincible&mdash;albeit
natural&mdash;dislike of publicity prevents the
production of evidence which would at least
establish the fact that his own belief in the
appearances by which he was visited is complete
and sincere.</p>

<p>Mr. Vantine, although a handsome and
intellectual-looking man, is by no means a
person whose appearance would in any way
single him out as likely to be the hero of
marvellous adventures. He is neither especially
imaginative nor credulous. He is simply
a clear-headed and shrewd business man,
such as are nourished in the atmosphere of
New York, of all places in the wide world,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
perhaps, the one least likely to nourish fancy
or belief in the unseen. To see him going
steadily about his affairs down town, it is
hardly probable that any observer, however
keen, would look on him as the probable
object of remarkable hallucinations, or of
experiences so far from the ordinary course
of human life, as sure to be classed as such
by ninety-nine men out of a hundred.</p>

<p>Yet John Vantine, of whom most of his
acquaintances would have said that he was a
commonplace man of business, lived for years
a double life, into which he did not venture
to initiate even his wife, with whom he lived
on terms of the warmest sympathy and closest
confidence.</p>

<p>It was on the morning of his wedding-day
that certain impressions, which in a vague
shape had for years haunted him, first took
form so definite that he could not but think
of them as something having a tangibility of
their own, different though it was from that
of the ordinary things which surround common
human life. He was married at the
home of his bride, a pretty village in western
Massachusetts. There being no hotel of even
decent comfort in the place, Vantine had
passed the night at the inn of a town half a
dozen miles away, whence he drove over in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
the dewy June morning to the scene of his
marriage.</p>

<p>As he passed along between the fields
starred with daisies, reflecting in blissful
mood upon the beauty of the day and the
happiness it brought to him, his horse came
suddenly and without warning to a standstill.
John instinctively gathered up the reins to
start the animal, when to his unspeakable
amazement he perceived a man in an Eastern
dress of great splendor standing beside the
open carriage. His robes were of the richest
stuffs, while jewels sparkled from every part
of his attire. He was standing apparently
upon a small rug, a circumstance which at
the moment impressed Vantine more than his
mysterious presence. The stranger saluted
the young man with the most profound obeisances,
and it was only after repeated genuflections
that he spoke. When he did address
Vantine, it was in a language of which the
latter did not even know the name, although
in some astonishing way he still comprehended
what was said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Great Master,&rdquo; the stranger greeted him,
&ldquo;will you receive an embassy to congratulate
you on your nuptials?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of course I cannot pretend here or elsewhere
to give the exact words in which my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
friend was addressed. It was some years
before he confided the story to me, and although
I have endeavored to set the words
down exactly as he gave them, it must be
borne in mind that he made no attempt at
literal verbal accuracy.</p>

<p>That a young man who had been nourished
amid the hard commonplaces of New York
life should be astounded by an address of
this sort was only natural. That Vantine did
not lose his head altogether was probably
due to certain vague and premonitory experiences
which he never defined very clearly,
alluding to them as &ldquo;passing fancies,&rdquo; &ldquo;nebulous
impressions,&rdquo; and by other phrases too
general to convey exact meaning to my mind.
On the present occasion, however, beyond a
rather prolonged silence before he answered
his interlocutor, he seems to have behaved
much as might a man stopped on the street
by an ordinary acquaintance. When he
spoke, he simply and laconically answered
&ldquo;Yes;&rdquo; and, as he did so, he swept with his
eye the wide horizon which the nature of the
country laid open to him, perceiving nowhere
sign of anything unusual.</p>

<p>Scarcely, however, had the monosyllable
left his lips when he saw upon the woodside
an enormous oriental rug cover the greensward,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
and instantly upon it stood a numerous
company, dressed in the most splendid
robes, saluting, and uttering stately but most
enthusiastic congratulations. In this, as in all
other instances in which my friend has seen
figures, the lower portions have appeared
first.</p>

<p>John sat in dignified and very probably
half-stupefied silence during this extraordinary
scene, and suddenly, without warning,
the whole pageant vanished into the limbo
from which it had come. He was once more
alone upon a country road, in the bright sunshine
of a June forenoon. It was his wedding
morning, and, the vision or whatever it
might properly be called having vanished,
there was obviously nothing to do but to
drive on and be married,&mdash;a course of action
which he carried out to the letter.</p>

<p>I have fancied, although it is a point upon
which I am doubtful, that John made some
beginning of a confidence to his bride during
the honeymoon of this extraordinary occurrence,
and that the levity with which she
received his first suggestions prevented his
going further in his disclosures. The reason
is, however, of no great consequence, but at
least the fact is that he did not tell her. He
gave a good deal of thought to the matter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
corresponded with the Psychical Society, of
London, not relating his own experience, but
endeavoring to learn of a parallel case. He
had, too, some communication with the Theosophical
Society, of London, and even with
the parent society, of Madras; and he at one
time contemplated making a confidant of
Madame Blavatsky, concerning whom, at that
time, the European papers were full of marvellous
tales.</p>

<p>He does not seem, so far as I am able to
gather from what he has told me, to have hit
upon any theory which afforded him a clue
to the mystery of his own case; and just as
he had made up his mind that the whole
was a mere optical delusion, he had a second
visitation.</p>

<p>He was in a Fifth Avenue car on the elevated
road, returning home at night. The
car was compactly filled, but before him, as
he sat facing the middle of the car, was an
open space, two or three feet square. Looking
up, as the train started after stopping
at the Twenty-third street station, John saw
standing before him the same oriental figure
which had greeted him on his wedding day.
The stranger&rsquo;s face beamed with joy, and he
scarcely waited to finish his profound salutation
before exclaiming, &ldquo;It is a propitious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
hour, Great Master. The young prince is a
pearl beyond price.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Vantine&rsquo;s first instinct was to look at his
neighbors, to see whether they too beheld
the apparition, if apparition it were. The
man on his right was looking up from his
newspaper with the air of one who had heard
the strange words and wished to discover
whence they came. The man on the left
was gazing at Vantine with an expression of
bewildered curiosity. John turned his eyes
again to the spot where his strange visitor
had been.</p>

<p>The place was vacant.</p>

<p>My friend, in relating this, blamed himself
severely that he had allowed a natural diffidence
to prevent his asking his neighbors
whether they had seen the &ldquo;Great Mogul,&rdquo;
as he began facetiously to dub the phantom
in his thoughts. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;nobody
likes to be taken for a raving idiot, even by
a stranger. They certainly looked as if they
had seen the figure, but I couldn&rsquo;t make
up my mind to ask.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Reaching home, John found that his wife
had been prematurely but safely delivered
of a lusty son. The messenger sent to his
office had missed him, and at the time of
the appearance in the car, he declares that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
he was not consciously even thinking of his
wife&rsquo;s condition at all.</p>

<p>When he had time to collect his thoughts
after this second visitation, Vantine came
firmly to the resolution that if he were ever
favored with a third sight of the &ldquo;Great
Mogul,&rdquo; he would at least endeavor to discover
whether the phantom were appreciable
by the sense of touch. He read much about
&ldquo;astral appearances,&rdquo; and a good many more
things of the sort, of which my own knowledge
is too limited to permit my writing at
all. He formed a hundred theories, and he
began to get somewhat confused, to use his
own expression, in regard to his identity.
He was half convinced that by some mis-working
of the law of re-incarnation, the
spirit of some Eastern potentate had been
put into his body.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or,&rdquo; said he, with a whimsicality which
was evidently deeply tinctured with a serious
feeling, &ldquo;that I had got into somebody&rsquo;s else
body. If I had known any possible way of
stopping the thing, it wouldn&rsquo;t have been so
bad; but to have the &lsquo;Great Mogul&rsquo; pop
up like a jack-in-a-box, without any warning,
was taking me at a disadvantage that I think
decidedly unfair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Not to lengthen unnecessarily a simple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
story, the speculations and investigations of
Vantine may be passed over, and the narrative
confined to the bare facts.</p>

<p>It was when John&rsquo;s boy was about two
months old that the embassy which had
greeted John upon his wedding morning, or
one closely resembling it, put in an appearance
in honor of the child&rsquo;s birth. The child
and its mother were taking their first drive,
and Vantine came home to luncheon rather
earlier than usual, to find them out. He went
into the library, but had scarcely closed the
door behind him, when the whole gorgeous
company of his wedding morning were before
him, and so real did they seem to him
that John entirely forgot his intention of
grasping the &ldquo;Great Mogul&rdquo; by the arm, to
convince himself of the reality of that personage.
The company overflowed with congratulations,
rather florid to my friend&rsquo;s
occidentally trained taste, but doubtless poetical
in the extreme from an oriental point of
view. Vantine was afterward amused and a
little surprised to remember how much as a
matter of course he took the adulation offered
him, and the ease with which he played the
rôle of &ldquo;Great Master.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But suddenly he became so thoroughly
amazed that all power of speech or motion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
seemed to forsake him. In the arms of the
&ldquo;Great Mogul&rdquo; he perceived his baby boy,
or an image that seemed to be the child, and
to the babe the brilliant company were kneeling
and swearing fealty. The whole ceremony
occupied about half an hour, at the end
of which time Vantine found himself once
more alone, and upon going downstairs he
met his wife and the nurse with the baby returning
from their drive.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s slept like a dormouse,&rdquo; Mrs. Vantine
said, in answer to her husband&rsquo;s inquiry.
&ldquo;I tried to rouse him once, but he wouldn&rsquo;t
wake. I was half frightened, but he seems
all right now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As they entered the parlor the maid came
to inquire if Mr. Vantine had brought company
to luncheon, as she had heard voices
in the library,&mdash;a circumstance which proved
that the sound of the voices of his ghostly visitors
was audible to other ears than his own.</p>

<p>John vainly wished that the baby, healthy,
awake and cooing now, could tell whether
dreams or strange experiences had troubled
its sleep while its father had seen its image;
but that is a point upon which he has never
received enlightenment.</p>

<p>It was one winter night when the baby was
six months old that the &ldquo;Great Mogul&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
presented himself again. My friend had been
taking a bath, and was dressing for bed when
the figure of his visions appeared, and with
every mark of terror and consternation prostrated
itself at his feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Great Master,&rdquo; it gasped in the usual formula,
&ldquo;pardon your slave&rsquo;s intrusion. The
enemy are upon us. They&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>With this sentence still unfinished, the
vision faded away in an instant, as if some
unforeseen catastrophe in whatever region it
came from had suddenly recalled the eidolon,
or projected presence, or whatever the thing
might be.</p>

<p>More confounded and disturbed than
ever, my friend retired to bed, but he was too
much excited to sleep. He had much the
feeling that one fancies a prince to have over
whose heritage distant armies are contending,
while he in forced inaction awaits the result.
No clue had been given which enabled him
to reach a solution of the mystery that involved
him, and nothing further transpired
during the night to render matters any
plainer.</p>

<p>On the following afternoon he was obliged
to start for Boston on business. As he was
elbowing his way through the crowd in the
Grand Central station, he heard at his ear the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
well known voice of the &ldquo;Great Mogul,&rdquo;
speaking as usual in the unknown tongue
which Vantine understood, yet the identity of
which he had never established. There was
no visible appearance this time, and the voice,
although distinctly audible, seemed to come
from a great distance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Great Master,&rdquo; the voice said, &ldquo;they are
beheading me. All is lost.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would be some comfort,&rdquo; John Vantine
said, rather irritably, when he confided this
strange story to me, &ldquo;to know what was lost.
It would have been uncommonly civil of the
&lsquo;Great Mogul&rsquo; to be a little more definite in
his information. If the poor fellow lost his
head in my service I am profoundly grateful,
of course; but precious little good does it do
me. Do you think the Psychical Society
would undertake the job of discovering in
what part of the universe I am rightfully
dubbed the Great Master and that young
rascal in the nursery is a prince! Unless
they can do something, I&rsquo;m afraid I shall
be a half-starved New York lawyer to the
end of the chapter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To which I had nothing satisfactory to
answer.</p>

<h2>THE RADIATOR.</h2>

<p class="center f8">A STUDY IN THE MODERN STYLE OF COLLOQUIAL
FICTION.</p>


<p>[<i>Scene, the chamber of Mr. and Mrs. Ellston, in an
apartment hotel. Time, three <span class="f8">A.&nbsp;M.</span> The silence of
the night is unbroken, save by the regular breathing
of the sleepers, until suddenly, from the steam radiator,
bursts a sound like the discharge of a battery of
forty-pound guns.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Mrs. E.</i> (<i>springing up in bed</i>) Oh! eh? what is
that?</p>

<p>[<i>Her husband moves uneasily in his sleep, but does
not reply. The noise of the sledge-hammer score of
the &ldquo;Anvil Chorus&rdquo; rings out from the radiator.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Mrs. E.</i> George! George! Something is going
to happen! Do wake up, or we shall be murdered
in our sleep!</p>

<p><i>Mr. E.</i> (<i>with mingled ferocity and amusement</i>)
There is small danger of anybody&rsquo;s being murdered
in his sleep, my dear, where you are. It&rsquo;s only
that confounded radiator; it&rsquo;s always making some
sort of an infernal tumult. It can&rsquo;t do any harm.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. E.</i> But it will wake baby.</p>

<p><i>Mr. E.</i> Well, if it does, the nurse can get him
to sleep again, I suppose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>[<i>From the room adjoining is heard a clattering din,
as if all the kettles and pans in the house were being
thrown violently across the floor.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Mrs. E.</i> There! The nursery radiator has begun.
I must go and get baby.</p>

<p><i>Mr. E.</i> Let baby alone. If the youngster will
sleep, for heaven&rsquo;s sake let him. The steam-pipes
make noise enough for this time of night, one
would think, without your taking the trouble to
wake baby.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. E.</i> (<i>with volumes of reproach in her tone</i>)
Your own little baby! You never loved him as
his mother does.</p>

<p>[<i>The disturbances now assume the likeness to a
thoroughly inebriated drum corps practising upon
sheet-iron air-tight stoves.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Mr. E.</i> Of all unendurable rackets&mdash;</p>

<p>[<i>A sudden and sharp boom interrupts him. Mrs.
Ellston screams, while her husband indulges in language
which, although somewhat inexcusably forcible,
is yet to be regarded as not unnatural under the circumstances.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Mrs. E.</i> Oh, George, don&rsquo;t swear. It always
seems so much worse to swear in danger; like
tempting Providence; and I know there&rsquo;s going
to be an explosion!</p>

<p><i>Mr. E.</i> (<i>severely</i>) Don&rsquo;t talk nonsense! The
engineer has gone to sleep and left the drafts open,
that&rsquo;s all. Don&rsquo;t be so absurd.</p>

<p>[<i>There is another fusillade from the radiator, reinforced
by the reverberations from the nursery, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
a regiment of artillery seem to have begun target
practice.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Mrs. E.</i> I <em>will</em> go and get my baby! I know&mdash; Oh,
George, just hear it crash! Do get up and
put the screen in front of it; that may turn off the
pieces so they won&rsquo;t come this way.</p>

<p><i>Mr. E.</i> (<i>scornfully</i>) Pieces of what? Noise?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. E.</i> How can you make fun? If the engineer
has gone to sleep, he&rsquo;s sure to blow up the
whole hotel. I&rsquo;m going to get up and dress myself,
and take baby over to mother&rsquo;s!</p>

<p><i>Mr. E.</i> (<i>with calm but cutting irony</i>) At three
o&rsquo;clock in the morning? Shall you walk, or call a
carriage?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. E.</i> (<i>beginning to sob in a dry and perfunctory
fashion</i>) Oh, you are too cruel! You are
perfectly heartless. I wonder you don&rsquo;t take that
dear little innocent baby and hold him between
you and the radiator for a shield.</p>

<p><i>Mr. E.</i> That might be a good scheme, my dear,
only the little beggar would probably howl so that
I haven&rsquo;t really the moral courage to wake him.</p>

<p>[<i>The indignant reply of Mrs. Ellston is lost in the
confused sound of the brays of a drove of brazen donkeys,
which appear to be disporting themselves in the
radiator. The noise of mighty rushing waters, the
clanking of chains, the din of a political convention,
the characteristic disturbances of a hundred factories
and machine-shops, with the deafening whirr of all
the elevated railways in the universe follow in turn.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Mrs. E.</i> I <em>will</em> go and get my baby, and I will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
<em>go</em> to mother&rsquo;s; and, what is more, we will never,
never come back!</p>

<p><i>Mr. E.</i> Oh, just as you please about going, my
dear; only you know that if you desert my bed
and board, the law gives the boy to me.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. E.</i> I don&rsquo;t <em>believe</em> it&rsquo;s any such thing;
and if it is, it is because men made the law.
Women wouldn&rsquo;t take a baby away from its
mother.</p>

<p><i>Mr. E.</i> Have what theories you choose, my
dear; only please let me get a few crumbs of sleep,
now the radiator has had the mercy to subside.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. E.</i> You are a brute, and I won&rsquo;t ever
speak to you again!</p>

<p>[<i>She firmly assumes a stony silence, and the radiator,
after a few concluding ejaculations and metallic
objurgations, also relapses into comparative stillness.
Mr. Ellston&rsquo;s breathing begins to give strong indications
that slumber has re-descended upon his weary
frame.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Mrs. E.</i> (<i>starting up with the inspiration of an
entirely new and startling idea</i>) George! George!
George!</p>

<p><i>Mr. E.</i> (<i>with less good humor than might be
desired</i>) Eh?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. E.</i> Wasn&rsquo;t it wonderful for baby to sleep
through it all?</p>

<p><i>Mr. E.</i> (<i>drowsily</i>) Yes; droll little beggar.
His mother wasn&rsquo;t in the nursery to wake him,
though.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mrs. E.</i> You don&rsquo;t suppose there is anything
the matter with him? George! George, I say!
you don&rsquo;t suppose the reason he sleeps so soundly
is because he&rsquo;s sick?</p>

<p>[<i>To this conundrum Mr. Ellston offers no solution,
and equally passes in silence queries in regard to the
probability of the nurse&rsquo;s being awake, alive, well-disposed,
and able to take care of baby in case of emergency.
Mrs. Ellston sighs with the desperation of
long-suffering anguish, and once more stillness reigns
in the chamber. The lady again arouses herself,
however, from an apparently sound nap to ask, in
penetrating tones,&mdash;</i>]</p>

<p>&ldquo;George, <em>do</em> you think it will begin all over
again?&rdquo;</p>

<p>(<i>To which her brutal worser half grumbles
out the reply</i>) &ldquo;No! and that&rsquo;s where it is more
endurable than a woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>[<i>At which the radiator gives a chuckle so apt as to
suggest the possession of a sinister consciousness on
the part of that noisy instrument of torture. Mrs.
Ellston groans, with the discouraged conviction that
she is but one against two, and upon this theory at
length consents to resume her interrupted slumbers.</i>]</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">It</span> was half-past eleven of a hot July
day in Paris. The sunlight lay
over the whole city and shone nowhere
more strongly than upon
the great hospital of the Salpêtrière. The
hush of noon brooded over all the place.
Nobody was stirring unless forced to activity
by some pressing duty. In the long white
wards the patients were asleep or lying quiet
in exhaustion under the burning fervor of the
summer heat.</p>

<p>Down one of the corridors, where it seemed
refreshingly cool after the warmth of the
outer air from which he had come, a young
man was passing. His step, though rapid,
had the noiseless quality which bespeaks
familiarity with the sick-room and the hospital.
His figure was compact and nervous,
his glance clear and keen. Dr. Jean Lommel
was one of the house physicians of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
Salpêtrière, although that he was not now
making his regular rounds was evident from
the fact that entering a certain ward he
passed quickly to a bed near the middle of
it without stopping at any of the others.</p>

<p>On the bed lay an old woman. Her face
was one which showed great strength of
character. It was of a marked peasant type,
and for all its innumerable wrinkles, its
sunken temples, the coarse texture of its
skin, and the shrunken lips which showed
the lack of teeth behind them, it was full of
a nobility and kindliness which no ravages
of time or disease could wholly hide. The
hair that straggled in thin locks from beneath
the white cap was hardly less snowy than the
lawn which covered it; and when the patient
opened her sunken eyes, as the doctor
stopped beside the bed, they were bright
and shining with a lustre which was not all
either fever or anxiety. Her glance was one
of intense and pitiful inquiry. The young
man touched her white hair with the tips of
his long, fine fingers in a pitying caress before
he took hold of the withered wrist,
shrunken and marked with blue veins, that
lay outside the coverlid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In an hour, Mère Marchette,&rdquo; he said,
answering her look&mdash;&ldquo;in an hour he will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
here; keep up a good heart. You do not
suffer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old woman feebly shook her head.
The ghost of a smile, faint but full of happiness,
shone on her face. She did not speak,
but she thanked him with a look before she
closed her eyes and lay motionless as before
he had come.</p>

<p>The young man looked at her a moment,
an expression of pity in his brown eyes; then
with a sigh he turned away and moved softly
down the ward again. By the door he encountered
one of the nurses, who had risen
and come forward to speak with him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will she live, M. Lommel?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the doctor answered. &ldquo;She has
given all her energies for days to keeping
alive till her grandson gets here. It is very
singular,&rdquo; he went on, in a voice of low distinctness
that could have been acquired only
in sick-rooms, &ldquo;how her instinct has taught
her to save her strength. She neither moves
nor speaks; she simply lives.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She has been that way,&rdquo; the nurse returned,
&ldquo;ever since we told her that Pierre
was coming. Will he be here by twelve?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not till half-past twelve,&rdquo; Dr. Lommel
replied. &ldquo;I will return before then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And he went out into the hot sunshine.</p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Everybody</span> connected with the ward of
the Salpêtrière wherein she was had a kindly
feeling for poor old Mère Marchette. The
doctors and the nurses could not have been
more kind or more tender had she been of
their own blood. She was one of those who
always win affection. She was so patient, so
simple, so kindly. She was a peasant woman
from Normandy, who had in her old age
drifted to Paris with her grandson Pierre, a
lad of sixteen years. All the rest of the family
were dead. Pierre&rsquo;s father had been a
soldier, and it was with the hope of securing
a pension for the son that Mère Marchette had
left her home and the life in Normandy she
loved, to throw herself into Paris as into the
sea. The dead soldier, however, had been
mustered out before the malarial fever, contracted
in the swamps of the Landes, had developed
itself, and the pension could not be
obtained. The disappointment was a bitter
one, made worse by the fact that Mère Marchette
had been told by one and another that
the claim would have been granted had the
case been properly managed. The poor old
creature could not escape a feeling of self-blame<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
in thinking that it was her want of
keenness which had deprived Pierre of his
pension. Her grandson for her represented
the world, and to him she devoted all her energies.
She toiled for him, and watched and
suffered with that unselfish egotism possible
only to the old and lonely.</p>

<p>Fortunately Pierre was a good lad, who
returned his grandmother&rsquo;s love with a devotion
hardly less complete than her own.
They lived together in two attic rooms,
where they passed the evenings sitting in
the dark and talking of their Normandy
home. They recalled the past and built
endless air castles of the time when they
should be able to return. They had grand
plans of repurchasing the old cot where both
of them had been born, and which had been
lost by the foreclosure of a mortgage after
the long illness of Pierre&rsquo;s father had ended.
They were never tired of talking of what
they would do then, and of devising little
ways in which the worn-out old farm might
be made more profitable. They remained
as truly children of the soil as if they had
been still in Normandy instead of in their
attic in the midst of Paris.</p>

<p>In the daytime Mère Marchette went out
to do work as charwoman, while Pierre had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
been fortunate enough to obtain a place as
assistant in a little grocery in Rue M. le
Prince. It was in connection with this
that Pierre gave his grandmother the only
real grief he ever caused her while they were
together. Suddenly the boy began to stay
away in the evening, and when Mère Marchette
sought to know the reason he put her
questions aside. One evening as she was
making her way home she saw her grandson
chatting with a girl at the door of a
milliner&rsquo;s dingy shop. The heart of poor
old Mère Marchette sunk within her. The
castles in the air, from whose glittering towers
had shone delusive lights to strengthen
and encourage her, fell in ruins before
her eyes. In a moment the burden of her
age, her poverty, her weariness, seemed increased
tenfold. Feebly she climbed the
long stairs and sat down to wait, heartbroken.
She had all the peasant&rsquo;s instinctive
distrust of Paris: she had not been able
to live in the Latin Quarter without comprehending
something of the evil about her,
although, happily for her, the worst features
of Parisian life would have been so unintelligible
that she might have seen them unmoved.
She thought no evil now of Pierre,
but she was seized with a terrible fear lest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
he might fall a victim to one of the sirens
of the Latin Quarter, who, to Mère Marchette&rsquo;s
thinking, destroyed soul and body
alike.</p>

<p>Mère Marchette did not tell Pierre of the
discovery she had made. She was only
more gentle with him, while in secret she
prayed more fervently. For some days
longer the lad&rsquo;s mysterious absence continued,
the sad hours of the evening stretching
like long deserts of agony, over which the
soul of Mère Marchette walked painfully
with bleeding feet. And then one night
Pierre came home with eyes aglow, and
all was explained. He put into his grandmother&rsquo;s
hand a little pile of francs, a sum
pitiful enough in itself but large to them,
and told how a milliner in the street beyond
had employed him in moving boxes and
clearing out the attics of her house, which
were to be remodelled into lodgings. This
had been his secret, and in his thought of
the joyful surprise he was to give his grandmother
he had forgotten the pain she might
endure by misunderstanding his absence.</p>

<p>It was such trifles as this that were the
great events in the life of Mère Marchette
and Pierre. There was a tenderness, an
unselfishness, an idyllic devotion in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
love which no amount of wealth, or culture,
or rank could have heightened; but in the
lad&rsquo;s veins was the blood of a soldier, that
stirred hot with the currents of a vigorous
youth. Of the army he had dreamed from
his cradle, and strong as was his love for
Mère Marchette the force of destiny was
stronger. It was the old tragedy of youth
and age, of the absorption of maternal love
and the restless impulses of the boy&rsquo;s heart.
Pierre justified his desire to himself with the
excuse that he could earn more money in
the ranks; but his grandmother knew, only
too well, the force of the instinct he had
inherited. She had seen the same struggle
in the life of his father.</p>

<p>When Pierre was eighteen he shouldered
his musket and marched away, leaving poor
old Mère Marchette as much a stranger in
Paris as when she had come to it two years
before to weep and pray alone. It would
hardly be within the power of words to paint
the anguish which lay between Pierre&rsquo;s departure
and that hot July noon when Mère Marchette
lay dying at the Salpêtrière. Always
in Paris she had been like a wild thing, caged
and bewildered, confused by the life that
swirled about her in the great city, even
when she had been sustained by the presence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
of Pierre. When he was gone the gentle
old soul began to die of homesickness and
heartbreak. For two years she fought death
stolidly but persistently, refusing to acknowledge
to herself that she was breaking down
under the stress of loneliness and sorrow.
She came of a race that died hard, and although
she was past eighty she looked forward
hopefully to the time when Pierre
should leave the army and come back to
live with her again.</p>

<p>But the struggle for existence in Paris
was hard, even when the joy of working
for Pierre sustained her; when he was gone
it became intolerable. At the end of two
years the strength and courage even of the
sturdy Norman peasant woman were exhausted;
and then a dreadful disease, which had
before shown itself in her family, seemed to
take advantage of her weakness to spring
upon her. She had been a charwoman in
the family of Jean Lommel&rsquo;s mother, and
so it came about that through the influence
of the young doctor she had been admitted
to the Salpêtrière when she was already
dying from cancer in the stomach.</p>

<p>There was no patient in the ward who
was not of better birth than Mère Marchette.
She was of all most deficient in education,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
in knowledge of the world, in the graces of
life; and yet of them all it was only the
poor old peasant woman who awakened in
the minds of the attendants a glow of genuine
affection. There are some people who
are born to be loved, and when these rare
beings remain worthy of it, neither age, nor
poverty, nor sickness can destroy their power
of awaking affection. The hired nurses
touched their lips to her forehead in kisses
given furtively, as if they were surprised,
and prepared to be ashamed of the emotion
which called from them this unwonted display.
The doctors spoke to her in tones
unprofessionally soft, while Dr. Lommel,
who had charge of the ward, treated her
with an affectionate courtesy scarcely less
warm than that he would have shown to his
own grandmother. They all knew that
Mère Marchette must die, and from counting
the time in weeks they had dropped to
days, and then to hours. Indeed it seemed
only the old woman&rsquo;s will which kept her
alive now until Pierre should come. She
had borne all her sufferings without a
murmur, but she had not been able wholly to
repress the cry of her heart. The young
soldier&rsquo;s regiment was in Algiers, and there
had been difficulties about his furlough.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
Had it been any other death-bed in the hospital
to which he had been summoned these
difficulties would hardly have been surmounted;
but in behalf of Mère Marchette
the physicians had worked so zealously that
all obstacles were removed and Pierre&rsquo;s leave
of absence granted. From the moment she
had been told that her grandson was on
his way she had been perfectly quiet, and,
as the doctor said, had devoted her whole
being to keeping alive until Pierre should
come.</p>

<p>And on this hot July noon the train which
was bringing Pierre was drawing nearer to
Paris, and Mère Marchette lay so still that
she seemed scarcely to breathe,&mdash;so still
that one might fancy she would not even
think, lest in so doing she exhaust some
precious grain of strength and so should die
without the blessing of that last embrace.</p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Whoever</span> keeps himself informed of the
course of modern scientific investigations is
likely to be aware that during the last decade
especial attention has been given at the Salpêtrière
to that strange physical or psychical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
force known as hypnotism. M. Charcot,
chief of the school of the Salpêtrière, has
particularly distinguished himself by his
researches. Attacked at first by his professional
brethren, it has been his good
fortune to live to see the scientific value of
hypnotism acknowledged, and to be triumphantly
readmitted to the Academy of Sciences,
which had at first stigmatized his
investigations as mere charlatanism. Charles
Féré, an assistant physician at the Salpêtrière,
with Richer, Bourneville, and nearly a score
other distinguished men, have pursued their
investigations with great zeal and thoroughness,
and have produced a valuable literature
devoted to this intricate subject.</p>

<p>It will be easily understood that all the
physicians at the Salpêtrière, and especially
the younger men, could not fail to be deeply
interested in this new and fascinating branch
of science. The facts upon which had been
founded the theories of mesmerism, animal
magnetism, and other shadowy systems were
reduced to order and scientifically tested.
M. Charcot and his associates worked with
much care and thoroughness, and, without
being able to solve the mystery of the force
with which they dealt, they proved its value
as a therapeutic agent. In the cure of nervous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
diseases, and in dealing with hysterical
patients, they obtained remarkable and satisfactory
results. They were even able to
alleviate suffering by simply assuring the
patient, while in a hypnotic sleep, that he
would be free from pain on waking.</p>

<p>To the outside observer no feature of this
strange power is more remarkable than the
influence the hypnotist may exert over his
subject after the trance is broken. A hypnotized
person may be told to perform any act
on awaking, and, when seemingly restored
to his normal condition, bears the impress
of that command so strongly that he is urged
to obey it by an irresistible impulse. It is
quite as easy, moreover, to foist upon the
patients the most extraordinary delusions.
The subject is told that upon awaking a
bottle will seem to be a lamp, a blank card
a picture, or any other deception which comes
into the mind of the hypnotist; and so perfect
is the working of this mysterious and
terrible law that the delusion is accomplished
to its minutest details.</p>

<p>Dr. Lommel, like all his young confrères,
had become intensely interested in all these
researches, so like a scientific realization of
the fairy tales of the Orient. He had even
tried some experiments on his own account;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
and when the sufferings of Mère Marchette
became pitifully intense he had ventured to
attempt the substitution of hypnotism for
opiates in relieving her distress. The old
woman had not easily yielded to this influence.
Susceptibility to hypnotism is more
apt to be found in hysterical or nervously
sensitive subjects than in such sturdy characters.
By degrees, however, Dr. Lommel
established control over her. In the end,
to throw her into a hypnotic sleep he had
only to hold his forefinger an inch or two
from her forehead, so that her eyes in
looking at it turned upward and inward a
little. He did not experiment with Mère
Marchette; he felt too tenderly toward the
old woman to make her the subject of scientific
investigation outside of the direct line
of treatment. He simply said, &ldquo;When you
awaken you will be free from pain, Mère
Marchette;&rdquo; then he would breathe lightly
on her forehead and the sick woman would
awaken, to lie as peaceful and painless as if
no terrible disease was gnawing like a tiger
at her vitals.</p>

<p>The case had attracted a good deal of attention
at the Salpêtrière, and although Mère
Marchette was utterly ignorant of it, her sick-bed
was a point of interest toward which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
were turned the thoughts of physicians over
half of Europe. The unlearned peasant, to
whom the simplest terms of science would
have been unintelligible, was furnishing data
for future scientific treatises; and people
of whose very existence she was unaware
read the daily bulletins of her condition with
closest eagerness.</p>


<h3>IV.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was a few minutes after twelve o&rsquo;clock
when Dr. Lommel reentered the ward. Mère
Marchette lay apparently sleeping, but as he
approached her bedside the old eyes opened
with a piercing and eager question. The
young man shook his head, smiling tenderly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not quite yet, Mère Marchette,&rdquo; he said;
&ldquo;there are still some minutes to wait.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He sat down beside the bed and laid his
fingers on her wrist. The pulse was so faint
that he could scarcely feel it, but it was
steady. For some minutes he remained
quiet, with his eyes fixed on the poor old
face before him. There came into his mind
the thought of what this woman&rsquo;s life had
been: her childhood and youth in the hut of
a Norman peasant; of what her own home
might have been when she became a wife<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
and mother; of the desolation which had
come upon her in the death of all her family
save only Pierre; of the strange fate that had
brought her to Paris; of the terrible wrench
which her old heart must have felt when her
grandson was taken from her; and of the
pathetic patience with which she had borne
privation, loneliness, and suffering.</p>

<p>He knew only the outlines of her history,
since Mère Marchette had spoken little of
herself. What her feelings might have been
he could only imagine: the old woman could
not have told her mental experiences; she
had never even analyzed them. Unless he
had been a peasant and a mother himself,
Lommel could not have divined Mère Marchette&rsquo;s
emotions; he could only reflect what
he should have felt in her place. He said
to himself at last that, after all, the circumstances
which made Mère Marchette&rsquo;s
lot so pathetic must also have deadened
her sensibilities and so have softened her
suffering.</p>

<p>He sighed and looked at his watch. His
assistant had gone to the railway station to
meet Pierre, and the time he had fixed for
their return was already past by five minutes.
He felt again of his patient&rsquo;s pulse, with a
terrible dread lest after all the young soldier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
should arrive too late. The artery throbbed
more feebly, but still steadily; and at his
touch the sick woman opened her eyes with
the old questioning look.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Patience, Mère Marchette,&rdquo; he said, nodding
encouragingly; &ldquo;all goes well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She did not speak, but she gave him a
look so eloquent with gratitude that words
were not needed. Then she lay quiet again
and the silent watch went on. Five minutes
passed, ten, fifteen; the young doctor became
extremely uneasy. At last in the distance
he heard a clock strike one. At the
sound Mère Marchette opened her eyes with
a quick, startled glance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pierre!&rdquo; she cried, in a voice of intense
love and terror.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Victor has gone to the station to meet
him; patience yet a little.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old woman regarded him with a look
of terrible pathos.</p>

<p>&ldquo;God could not let me die without seeing
Pierre,&rdquo; she murmured.</p>

<p>At that moment, through the still afternoon,
was heard the sound of a carriage.
Mère Marchette&rsquo;s eyes shone with a wild and
fevered expression.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must be calm,&rdquo; Lommel said. &ldquo;I
will bring him to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>He administered the little stimulant she
could take, and passed quickly out into the
corridor.</p>


<h3>V.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Lommel</span> closed the door of the ward
behind him and started down the corridor,
but at the first step he stopped suddenly with
a terrible sinking of the heart. Victor was
coming toward him, but alone, and with a
white face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Victor,&rdquo; Jean cried, in a voice intense but
low, &ldquo;what has happened? Where is Pierre?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There has been an accident,&rdquo; Victor returned.
&ldquo;A bridge broke under his train.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you do not know&mdash;&rdquo; began Lommel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the other interrupted; &ldquo;M. de
Brue, who was on the train and escaped with
a broken arm, was in the same compartment
with Pierre. He rode through on the engine
that came in for help. Pierre had told him I
was to meet him, and so when M. de Brue
saw me he stopped to say that the soldier was
struck on the chest and killed instantly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dr. Lommel stood regarding his companion
with terror and compassion in his look.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">O mon Dieu!</i>&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;poor Mère
Marchette!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It will kill her,&rdquo; Victor responded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is nothing,&rdquo; was the doctor&rsquo;s reply.
&ldquo;It is not death, but the agony she will
suffer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that moment the nurse came out of the
ward and hurried down the corridor to join
them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;M. le Docteur,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I beg your
pardon, but the excitement of Mère Marchette
is so great that I venture to suggest
that her grandson hurry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She glanced around as she spoke, and saw
that he was not there. An exclamation rose
to her lips; the doctor checked her by a
glance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go back to Mère Marchette,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and
say that I am cautioning Pierre&mdash; Stay,
I will go myself. Wait here, Victor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He went back into the ward and passed
down between the cots, from which eyes that
the indifference of illness scarcely left human,
watched him with faint curiosity. Mère Marchette
was sitting up in bed, trembling with
eagerness and excitement. All the reserve
which she had maintained for weeks had been
swept aside. The moment for which she had
kept herself alive had come at last, and there
was no longer any need to save her energy.
Her eyes shone, a feverish glow was on her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
cheek, even her withered lips had taken on
for the moment a wan and ghostly red. It
seemed to the doctor, as he looked at her, as
if all the vitality which remained in her feeble
frame was being expended in a last quick fire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have been warning
Pierre to be calm, when it is you to whom I
should speak. Come, it will take only a moment,
but I must give you treatment before I
can let you see him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he spoke he put his forefinger up to her
forehead with a gesture he always used in
hypnotizing her. Mère Marchette struggled
a moment as if she could not yield to anything
which delayed her reunion with Pierre;
then she sank into a hypnotic sleep. The
doctor leaned forward and spoke with an
emphasis which he had never before used
with his patient.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When you awake,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you will see
Pierre; the person I shall bring to you is
your grandson. Remember,&rdquo; he repeated,
&ldquo;it is Pierre who will come in with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He breathed on her eyelids in the usual
method of awaking her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I will bring him, Mère
Marchette.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He went back to where Victor and the
nurse were awaiting him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Victor,&rdquo; he said quickly, &ldquo;you know the
experiment M. Charcot tried yesterday when
he made a hypnotized patient believe one
person was another; I have told Mère Marchette
that you are Pierre. You must take
his place; come quickly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young man drew back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot,&rdquo; he protested.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must,&rdquo; Lommel returned, almost
fiercely. &ldquo;Come.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>VI.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was with terrible inward misgiving that
Jean and Victor entered the ward; but as
soon as the eyes of Mère Marchette fell upon
the latter they knew that the experiment was
a success. Such a look of yearning love illumined
the withered old features, such an
unspeakable joy shone in the sunken eyes,
such quivering eagerness was expressed by
the outstretched hands, that the young men
found their way to the bedside blinded by
tears. An inarticulate cry, that was half
moan and half sob, burst from the lips of
Mère Marchette as Victor fell on his knees
by the bedside. Carried out of himself by
genuine feeling, the young man had no need<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
to simulate the emotions necessary for the
part he was playing. Seizing the wrinkled
hand which lay before him on the bed he
covered it with tears and kisses; then, with
a cry of piercing sweetness, Mère Marchette
flung herself forward into his arms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O Pierre, Pierre!&rdquo; she sobbed. &ldquo;Oh, the
good God, the good God!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She clasped her arms about his neck, she
strained him to her breast, the feebleness of
her dying embrace transformed to strength
by the divine fervor of maternal love. She
mingled her kisses with a soft and hardly
articulate babble of endearing words; the
terms which she had used over his cradle she
mingled with the pet names of his childhood
and the loving speech which belonged to
maturer years. She held him away from her
that she might look at him, and her eyes
were holden so that she saw in his face the
changes that her fancy had pictured in thinking
of the real Pierre.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;how brown thou hast
grown; and thou art such a man now! Ah,
thou rogue,&rdquo; she went on, laughing softly, &ldquo;I
knew thou hadst grown a beard&mdash;and not a
word of it in thy letters. But I knew.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She put her thin fingers under his chin and
with a sudden gravity lifted his face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Look in my eyes,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;why dost
thou turn away? Hast thou not been a good
boy; hast thou not loved the good God?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Poor Victor, overwhelmed with the dreadful
consciousness of deceit, found it almost
impossible, in face of this touching and pious
affection, to meet the old woman&rsquo;s glance.
He struggled to force himself to look into her
eyes unwaveringly. Dr. Lommel laid his
hand upon his companion&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mère Marchette,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;Pierre
is a good lad; that I will answer for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old woman raised her eyes toward
heaven, and her lips moved. She was evidently
praying. She had received extreme
unction just before noon, but this moment in
which she commended her grandson to God
was to her no less solemn than that of her
own last communion. Then she put out her
hand to Dr. Lommel with her smile of wonderful
sweetness and an air of noble simplicity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have been so kind to old Mère Marchette,&rdquo;
were her words; &ldquo;the good God
will reward you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked at the old dying peasant woman
and tried to speak, but his sobs choked him.
He bent and kissed her hand and laid it back
gently in that of Victor. Her little strength
was evidently failing fast. With a last effort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
she made a movement to drag herself nearer
to Victor. He understood her wish and supported
her in his arms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Promise me,&rdquo; she murmured, her voice
wasted almost to a whisper, &ldquo;that thou wilt
be good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I promise,&rdquo; he answered.</p>

<p>And the words were no less sincere because
she mistook the speaker. A smile of heavenly
rapture came over her face; she tried to speak
and failed. But Victor understood her wish
and kissed her. As their lips parted she
sighed quiveringly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is dead,&rdquo; said Dr. Lommel.</p>


<h3>VII.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Victor</span> laid the body gently back upon
the bed and rose to his feet. He seized his
friend by the shoulders; the tears were
streaming down his cheeks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mon Dieu</i>, Jean!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;to deceive
such trust. I feel as if I had been violating
a sacrament.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; the other answered; &ldquo;but ah,
how happy she was!&rdquo;</p>

<p>[<i>A drawing-room. Fanny Motley, who has been
making a long call upon her bosom friend, Alice
Langley, has at last risen to go.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Alice.</i> Oh, don&rsquo;t go yet. I haven&rsquo;t told you
half the things I wanted to.</p>

<p><i>Fanny.</i> Oh, I must go. I&rsquo;ve got to go home to
dress for Mrs. Fresco&rsquo;s dinner. <em>Do</em> you suppose
Jack will be there?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> He told me he was going.</p>

<p><i>F.</i> Oh, I do <em>hope</em> he won&rsquo;t fail. I do <em>so</em> want
to joke him about his sleigh-ride with Ella. Do
you suppose she wore her hat with the orange
plumes? It&rsquo;s awfully unbecoming to her. It
makes her look just salmon color.</p>

<p><i>A.</i> She always had perfectly hideous taste. Do
you remember that dowdy gown of green plush
and mauve tulle she wore to Kate West&rsquo;s german?
It was a perfect dream of horror.</p>

<p><i>F.</i> Yes; didn&rsquo;t she look <em>per</em>-fectly hideous?
Well (<i>moving toward the door</i>), come and see me
just as soon as you can.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p><i>A.</i> I&rsquo;ll come in to-morrow before sewing-circle,
if I can, to hear about the dinner. Don&rsquo;t be too
hard on Jack. You know he&rsquo;s <em>aw</em>-fully thin-skinned.</p>

<p><i>F.</i> Oh, I won&rsquo;t be hard on him.</p>

<p><i>A.</i> (<i>pausing as they reach the door</i>) Is that the
boa you had Christmas?</p>

<p><i>F.</i> Yes; isn&rsquo;t it lovely? But I told mamma I
knew she got it because she knew I&rsquo;d got to have
one, and she&rsquo;d got to give me something.</p>

<p><i>A.</i> How mean of you!</p>

<p><i>F.</i> Oh, she didn&rsquo;t mind. She&rsquo;s used to it. Be
sure and come in to-morrow.</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Yes, I will. Oh, did I tell you that Tom
Jones has invited Sophia Weston to go to the
opera Saturday night?</p>

<p><i>F.</i> You don&rsquo;t mean it. Has he, really?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Yes; Ethel Mott told me this morning.</p>

<p><i>F.</i> <em>Do</em> you suppose he is in earnest, after all?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Oh, there&rsquo;s no telling about him. Frank
says they bet about it at the club.</p>

<p><i>F.</i> About him and Sophia?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Yes; whether he&rsquo;ll propose before Lent.</p>

<p><i>F.</i> How <em>per</em>-fectly horrid! Men are the <em>worst</em>
creatures. I declare, I think those dreadful clubs
ought to be suppressed.</p>

<p><i>A.</i> So do I. They do say the most outrageous
things. I don&rsquo;t see how they can sit and listen to
them.</p>

<p><i>F.</i> I don&rsquo;t, either.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p><i>A.</i> And they talk over all the scandals.</p>

<p><i>F.</i> Yes, it is simply diabolical. How perfectly
sweet it is to have a brother who will tell you all
about it.</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Isn&rsquo;t it? It is almost as good as going
myself.</p>

<p><i>F.</i> Will never tells me a single thing (<i>moving
on into the hall</i>). Well, be sure you come, and
come as early as you can. Good-bye. (<i>Kisses
her.</i>)</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Good-bye. That boa is just as becoming
as it can be.</p>

<p><i>F.</i> Do you think so? Clara Martin&rsquo;s makes
her look as if she hadn&rsquo;t any neck at all.</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Oh, you can wear anything.</p>

<p><i>F.</i> Thank you, dear. But then you can afford
to say so, because you can wear anything yourself.
Would you ask Jack about the orange feathers?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Oh, he wouldn&rsquo;t know. Men never know
what girls have on,&mdash;except Clarence Key, and
he&rsquo;s a perfect man-milliner. Did I tell you what
he said to Kate West at the Westons&rsquo; tea? I&rsquo;d
have scratched his eyes out.</p>

<p><i>F.</i> No; what in the world did he say?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> You won&rsquo;t repeat it? Because I told Kate
I wouldn&rsquo;t tell. She was so furious she had to tell
somebody.</p>

<p><i>F.</i> I&rsquo;ll never tell. What was it?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> You know that tailor-made gown she wears?
The one made of gray corduroy? Well, Clarence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
Key asked her if she got it so her husband could
have it made into riding trousers, after she was
done with it. Did you ever <em>hear</em> such impertinence?</p>

<p><i>F.</i> He didn&rsquo;t really!</p>

<p><i>A.</i> He really did!</p>

<p><i>F.</i> Why, Alice! I should think she&rsquo;d have
killed him. I would.</p>

<p><i>A.</i> So would I.</p>

<p><i>F.</i> (<i>putting her hand on the handle of the door</i>)
Well, good-bye. Give my love to Blanche when
you write.</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Yes, I will.</p>

<p><i>F.</i> I shall see you to-morrow?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Yes. Good-bye.</p>

<p>[<i>Fanny opens the door, and a blast of cold wind
rushes in.</i>]</p>

<p><i>F.</i> Ugh! How awfully cold it is. I wish I
had taken the carriage.</p>

<p><i>A.</i> I went over to Ethel Mott&rsquo;s this morning,
and I thought I should freeze to <em>death</em>.</p>

<p><i>F.</i> I hope I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t get pneumonia or anything.
I want to go to the Claytons&rsquo; ball.</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Oh, do tell me; what are you going to wear?</p>

<p><i>F.</i> (<i>returning and closing the door</i>) There, that
is one thing I wanted to ask you about. I want
you to go in white, and I&rsquo;ll wear that black lace I
had made in New York last winter. I&rsquo;ve never
worn it here at all, and that&rsquo;s the most stylish
gown I ever had in my whole life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p><i>A.</i> Wouldn&rsquo;t that be striking? We could go
in together. I&rsquo;ll have a new white tulle, and
wear my pearls. I&rsquo;ll make Aunt Alicia lend me
hers, too.</p>

<p><i>F.</i> That will be <em>too</em> lovely.</p>

<p><i>A.</i> And you&rsquo;ll wear diamonds?</p>

<p><i>F.</i> Oh, no. I wore jet in New York. Not a
single thing but black about me; not even my
fan-sticks.</p>

<p><i>A.</i> How <em>per</em>-fectly enchanting!</p>

<p><i>F.</i> Will you do it?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Of course I will. I&rsquo;ll buy the stuff to-morrow.</p>

<p><i>F.</i> We&rsquo;ll talk about it when you come to-morrow.
(<i>Opening the door.</i>) I must go this very
moment, or I shall <em>never</em> get to Mrs. Fresco&rsquo;s.</p>

<p><i>A.</i> What are you going to wear to-night?</p>

<p><i>F.</i> That cardinal I showed you the other day.</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Isn&rsquo;t that rather gorgeous?</p>

<p><i>F.</i> Oh, it&rsquo;s going to be a big dinner, you know;
and there&rsquo;s lots of black lace on it.</p>

<p><i>A.</i> It must be awfully becoming.</p>

<p><i>F.</i> It is. If Jack knows anything, he ought to
see a difference between that and orange plumes.</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Ethel Mott told me&mdash; Oh, do come in a
moment. I&rsquo;m simply freezing to death, and I
must tell you this.</p>

<p><i>F.</i> (<i>once more coming in and closing the door</i>)
Well, do be quick. I ought to have been home
long ago.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p><i>A.</i> Oh, you&rsquo;ve lots of time.</p>

<p><i>F.</i> But it takes so long to do my hair.</p>

<p><i>A.</i> How are you going to wear it?</p>

<p><i>F.</i> The same old way. I wish somebody&rsquo;d
invent some new style,&mdash;something real nice and
becoming. I asked Uncle Calvin the other night
if he hadn&rsquo;t seen some pretty styles in China,
and I wish you could have <em>seen</em> the pictures he
brought out!</p>

<p><i>A.</i> What were they like?</p>

<p><i>F.</i> Like? They weren&rsquo;t like anything. Why,
I just <em>gasped</em> over them! Ships, and butterflies,
and all sorts of things; all made out of hair, right
on your own head.</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Not really?</p>

<p><i>F.</i> Yes, just as I tell you. I never <em>saw</em> anything
so frightful.</p>

<p><i>A.</i> It must have been perfectly ghastly!</p>

<p><i>F.</i> Well, good-bye. Come early. Oh! what
were you going to tell me?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> To tell you?</p>

<p><i>F.</i> Yes,&mdash;that Ethel Mott said.</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Oh, she said that Kate West has been corresponding
all winter with that West Point cadet
she met at Newport last summer.</p>

<p><i>F.</i> No!</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Yes!</p>

<p><i>F.</i> Why, Alice Langley, do you mean it?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Ethel said she knew it.</p>

<p><i>F.</i> I don&rsquo;t believe it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p><i>A.</i> That&rsquo;s what I said.</p>

<p><i>F.</i> But she&rsquo;s as good as engaged to George
Maynard.</p>

<p><i>A.</i> I know it.</p>

<p><i>F.</i> I think it&rsquo;s perfectly awful.</p>

<p><i>A.</i> So do I.</p>

<p><i>F.</i> Do you suppose he knows it?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Oh, no. He&rsquo;s so gone on Kate, he thinks
she&rsquo;d never look at anybody but him.</p>

<p><i>F.</i> I never heard anything so perfectly amazing
in my life.</p>

<p><i>A.</i> And sometimes, Ethel says, they write each
other two letters a week.</p>

<p><i>F.</i> Two letters?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Two letters.</p>

<p><i>F.</i> In one week?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> That&rsquo;s what Ethel says.</p>

<p><i>F.</i> I wonder she doesn&rsquo;t expect the ground to
open and swallow her. I never heard of such
deceit. Why, she&rsquo;s going to lead the german
with George at the Wentworths&rsquo; next week.</p>

<p><i>A.</i> I know it.</p>

<p><i>F.</i> Well, I&rsquo;ve always said Kate West couldn&rsquo;t
be trusted out of your sight. (<i>She turns, and
opens the door.</i>) I do believe that every time I
open that door it is colder. I know I shall die
before I get home,&mdash;or freeze my ears.</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Think how dreadful it would be to freeze
your ears. I knew a girl at boarding-school that
froze her ears skating one vacation, and they hung<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
down like rags. We used to tell her they were
like a spaniel&rsquo;s, and call her Fido. She&rsquo;d get
<em>perfectly</em> furious.</p>

<p><i>F.</i> I don&rsquo;t wonder.</p>

<p><i>A.</i> It was awfully good fun to see how she tried
to pretend she didn&rsquo;t care; and then, when she
couldn&rsquo;t stand it another minute, she&rsquo;d catch up
the very first thing she could lay her hands on, and
throw it.</p>

<p><i>F.</i> (<i>descending the steps</i>) I would if I&rsquo;d been
she. Could she wear ear-rings?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Oh, not for the longest time,&mdash;as much as
a year, any way. When we wanted to be especially
pleasant, we told her that frozen ears always
came off after a time.</p>

<p><i>F.</i> How horrid!</p>

<p><i>A.</i> But it was such fun!</p>

<p><i>F.</i> Good-bye. Be sure and come to-morrow.</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Yes.</p>

<p><i>F.</i> And come early.</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Yes; I&rsquo;ll come right after luncheon.</p>

<p><i>F.</i> Don&rsquo;t you think your gown ought to be
made just like my black one?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Yes; that would be more effective.</p>

<p><i>F.</i> And then we can wear our hair just alike.</p>

<p><i>A.</i> It&rsquo;s a pity you couldn&rsquo;t have some black
flowers.</p>

<p><i>F.</i> Yes. I don&rsquo;t see why the florists don&rsquo;t get
up some. Phew! It&rsquo;s as cold as Greenland.
Do go in. You&rsquo;ll get your death cold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p><i>A.</i> Good-bye. Don&rsquo;t tell what I told you.</p>

<p><i>F.</i> No; not to a soul. How did Ethel Mott
find out about the letters?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> She wouldn&rsquo;t tell.</p>

<p><i>F.</i> Do you suppose she really knew, or only
guessed?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> She said she really and truly knew.</p>

<p><i>F.</i> Isn&rsquo;t it amazing?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> It is <em>per</em>-fectly incomprehensible.</p>

<p>E. Well, good-bye. I hope you&rsquo;ll have good
luck at the Whist Club to-night.</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Oh, do come back till I tell you what Mr.
Fremont said about the Whist Club.</p>

<p>[<i>Fanny returns to the foot of the steps, and Alice
goes half way down to meet her.</i>]</p>

<p><i>A.</i> He said he wasn&rsquo;t going to the Whist Club
any more, and I asked him why not, and he said
he was tired of taking girls down to feed, when
they&rsquo;d been talking so all the evening that he
couldn&rsquo;t play.</p>

<p><i>F.</i> Why, I never heard anything so insulting!</p>

<p><i>A.</i> I told Mr. Van Bruch, and he said the
trouble was that Mr. Fremont wanted all the time
to feed himself.</p>

<p><i>F.</i> Good. Do you know Colonel Graham says
that he went to the Vaughns&rsquo; to play whist, and they
held a conversazione instead. Wasn&rsquo;t that clever?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Yes; awfully.</p>

<p><i>F.</i> Good-bye. I&rsquo;ll tell Jane to lay out my
black dress, so it will be all ready when you come.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p><i>A.</i> I&rsquo;ll try and get time to go down town in
the morning, to see what I can get to make my
gown of. It&rsquo;s an awful shame you had to hurry
away so; I had lots of things to say.</p>

<p><i>F.</i> Well, I really had to go, you know. You
can&rsquo;t keep a dinner party waiting, of course.</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Oh, of course not. Good-bye. I&rsquo;m awfully
glad you came.</p>

<p><i>F.</i> Good-bye. I&rsquo;ve had a lovely time.</p>

<p>[<i>She at last really goes, and Alice, after lingering
a second to regret the things she has not said, retires
and closes the door of the now pretty well aired house.</i>]</p>

<h2>BARUM WEST&rsquo;S EXTRAVAGANZA.</h2>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/drop_b.jpg" width="62" height="62" alt="B" title="B" />
</div>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Barum West</span> threw down his pen,
and looked about his attic with a
gloomy face. The light from his
one window, a dormer facing the
east, was too faint to permit his writing any
longer, even had he been in the mood; and
how far he was from desiring to go on with
his work was shown by his seizing the sheets
which were the result of his afternoon&rsquo;s labor,
and angrily tearing them into bits.</p>

<p>The room was not unlike the traditional
abode of that melancholy thing, a poor-devil
author. The roof sloped from the middle of
the ceiling almost to the floor, the niche of
the dormer-window where his writing-table
stood being the only part of the eastern side
of the chamber where one could stand upright.
In the corner on the opposite side
stood an old-fashioned, high-posted bedstead;
a bureau, over which hung a tarnished mirror
of antique frame, was placed opposite the tall
stove, in which was carefully cherished a frugal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
coal fire; a black trunk was pushed under
the eaves, while some pine shelves held the
young man&rsquo;s unimposing library. Both carpet
and wall-paper were dingy and faded, and
in the darkening winter twilight the attic was
gloomy enough to depress the spirits of one
in a frame of mind far more cheerful than
that in which West found himself.</p>

<p>Most authors are too unhappily familiar
with the fact that a financial crisis is apt to
be so desperately unproductive of marketable
ideas that even the excitement of a definite
order is likely, at such a time, to beget in the
brain rather a confused sense of impotence
than a creative inspiration. One must be well
seasoned in the vicissitudes of a literary career
to be able to do his best under the combined
pressure of sore need and the necessity of
seizing at once an unusual opportunity. West
was still young in his profession, as well as in
years, and the wild exhilaration of receiving
a conditional commission had given place to
an awful feeling of despairing helplessness.
A friend who had considerable confidence
in him, and, what was more to the purpose,
some acquaintance and influence in theatrical
circles, had persuaded a manager to promise
to consider an extravaganza from the pen
of the would-be playwright, and Barum felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
as if his whole future depended upon his
success.</p>

<p>He had started upon his task with the
utmost hope and confidence. He had for
a couple of years been studying stage work,
writing plays that nobody would touch, and
serving that dreary apprenticeship which
comes before literary success, but which is,
unhappily, not always followed by it. He had
pinned above his writing-table a sentence from
&ldquo;Earl&rsquo;s Dene,&rdquo; which had afforded him a
sombre support often enough: &ldquo;The only
road to the skies, Mademoiselle, is up the
garret stairs. Mozart climbed them, Moretti
climbed them, ... everybody who has ever
done anything has had to climb them; and
you, Mademoiselle, are one whose duty for
the present is to starve.&rdquo; It may have been
because he secretly felt that he had starved
long enough, or from the buoyant hope
pathetically natural to youth, that West was
convinced that his time had come; but at
least of that fact he had no doubt.</p>

<p>When, however, he sat down to write, he
found his brain teeming, in place of valuable
ideas, with the single notion that this time
he must succeed; instead of a plot, his mind
spun visions of coming greatness; and in place
of elaborating witticisms, his thoughts turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
alternately to dismal memories and to yet more
gloomy forebodings. To-day ended a week
of futile endeavor, and the unlucky writer
was forced to confess to himself that, so far
from being further on in his work than he
was seven days earlier, he had stuck where
he set out, and acquired the fatal hindrance
of a self-distrust which benumbed all his
powers.</p>

<p>It grew quickly darker as he brooded, the
brief February twilight shutting down rapidly.
It was so dark when at last he got heavily
upon his feet that he was obliged to fumble
about for his shabby hat and coat in the shallow
closet which held his scant wardrobe. He
muttered to himself as he did so a quotation
from Octave Feuillet. He could hardly have
been an aspirant for literary honors, and not
be crammed to the throat with quotations.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ce n&rsquo;est donc pas un vain mot, la faim!</i>&rsquo;&rdquo;
he said aloud, with so much bitterness that
a hearer, had there been one, might have forgiven
his sentimentality. &ldquo;&lsquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Il y a donc vraiment
une maladie de ce nom-là.</i>&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He went down the three flights of stairs
which lay between his chamber and the sordid
street, taking his way to a cheap restaurant,
which his soul loathed, but to which the
narrowness of his purse constrained him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
The waiter-girls, gossiping together, knew
his shabby figure too well to hasten to serve
him with any alacrity born of expectation of
tips; but one of them came to stand, leaning
by one hand upon the table, while he studied
the bill of fare in a vain attempt to discover
some dish which would be alike satisfactory
to his appetite and his finances. There were
stains of coffee and of soup upon the card,
which gave him a feeling of disgust, as if his
food had been served in an unwashed dish;
but he repressed his feelings and made out
his meagre order. The damsel filled him the
usual glass of ice-water, tossed an evening
paper before him, and betook herself to cry
the supper he had called for into the mouth
of a rubber tube, which hung flabbily out of
the wall. West could hear the voice of somebody
under ground repeating the order, like
a surly subterranean echo, and he was peevishly
half inclined to fling a plate at the
head of a man at the next table, on the
supposition that that individual might have
been listening to this double disclosure of
the straitness of diet to which his poverty
constrained him.</p>

<p>He tried to interest himself in the paper
which had been given him. He picked out
the smallest paragraphs with a feeling of being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
so much at variance with the world in general
that nothing could possibly interest him which
was not held to be of no especial moment to
the majority. Suddenly he felt that little thrill
with which a man always comes upon his
name in print. Among a lot of brief jottings
was the statement that a man in Chicago had
left two hundred thousand dollars to Barum
West. For a moment his heart seemed to
stand still, but instantly his common sense
reasserted itself, and he smiled with the bitter
but fleeting cynicism of youth at the impossibility
that a fortune should come to him by
any lucky throw of Fortune&rsquo;s dice. The name
was sufficiently uncommon, however, to make
the coincidence striking, and what artistic
youth, so placed that his wits were more or
less disconcerted by the unevenness of life,
could fail to make the paragraph the starting-point
for a thousand dreams.</p>

<p>All that night, when he should have been
sleeping, and when he really was half under the
influence of slumber, Barum West&rsquo;s thoughts,
which should have been devising stage situations,
droll dialogue, and popular allusions,
occupied themselves with that illusive fortune.
He considered what he would do did
he really have it; how he would enjoy it;
what delights he would purchase, and what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
miseries escape. In dreams his fancy wove
a gorgeous tissue of enchantment, at which
he smiled when he waked, although in reality
it was little more extravagant than the airy
fabric of his waking fancies. When once an
imaginative youth gives rein to his fancy, especially
if hope and need prick the tricksy
steed forward, there is no telling to what
lengths the race it runs may not stretch.
West certainly did not believe that the legacy
of which he had seen mention was really
intended for his pocket, and yet the coincidence
of the name seemed to him so good
proof that it went far toward persuading him
that he was, in truth, the legatee. For the
rest, he, perhaps not unconsciously, humored
a little a dream which at least amused for the
time being a life all too little lightened by
frivolity of any sort.</p>

<p>It was not until the following evening that
it occurred to West that, having a fortune in
hand, it would be necessary for him to invest
it. He was once more at the eating-house,
which to-night he regarded with less bitterness
than hitherto, so strong was the effect
of his dream in putting him in better temper
toward life and the world. As he scanned
the paper, in the hope that he might come
upon some further information in regard to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
Barum West&rsquo;s fortune, his eye lighted on the
stock reports, and, with a sudden sense of
importance he reflected that with two hundred
thousand dollars to take care of it
behooved him to furbish up whatever knowledge
he possessed of stocks. The unintelligibility
of the stock reports was sufficient
proof that he had little knowledge to furbish,
but this only aroused his combativeness, and
made him determined to learn.</p>

<p>When he left the restaurant he bought a
paper of his own, and taking it to his room,
he passed the evening in studying finance as
represented in the columns of the daily
journal. There was something amusing, or
pathetic, as one might look at it, about the
absorption with which he gave himself to the
occupation of deciding what he should do
with $200,000 if he had it. He reflected
shrewdly that it were wise not to invest his
whole capital in a single stock, and he tried
to recall whatever he had heard of the relative
safety of different classes of security.
He guessed at the amount of commission he
would be obliged to pay a broker, his guide
being a confused remembrance that in a play
he had heard a certain rate mentioned. He
carefully tabulated his investments, and retired
at length, the possessor of an income<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
of something over $11,000, all commissions
having been paid.</p>

<p>It was perhaps not strange that Barum
was in absolute ignorance of the fact, since
a knowledge of the vagaries of the stock
market was decidedly outside of his world,
but the truth was that he had begun to manage
his fancied fortunes on a falling market
when the bears were raging in Wall Street.
While he slept that night a combination was
being completed which was the next day to
run down twenty-five per cent the conservative
railroad stock in which West had felt it
safe to put half his fairy gold. When Barum
took up the paper at the restaurant on the
third evening he had lost about $40,000,&mdash;a
fact which could hardly have caused him
more chagrin had he really possessed the
money to lose.</p>

<p>The game he was playing interested him
like a new novel. His quick imagination
had taken fire, and this defeat spurred him
to a fresh endeavor. He felt himself in
honor bound to regain what he had lost;
and this evening went like the last, in complicated
and decidedly amateurish efforts to
bring his imaginary finances into a satisfactory
condition. The writing of the play of
which he was to read the skeleton to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
manager in a fortnight advanced not at all.
He took his pen to write, and laid it down
to refresh his memory on the latest quotation
on some stock; he tried to think of his plot,
and found himself reflecting concerning debenture
bonds and second mortgages, with
the vaguest possible notion of what either
might be.</p>

<p>The strange possession which a vivid fancy
may take of a lonely and imaginative mind
is a phenomenon not unfamiliar to those who
have studied the lives of men of fervid temperament;
and the whim to which West now
gave himself up was no more extravagant
than many another which has had consequences
far more serious. For days he went
on, becoming more and more completely engrossed
by the folly he was following. His
writing-table was covered with papers upon
which he had memoranda of stocks, of
sales, of investments, calculations of commissions,
and all the rest of it. He even
thought of going down town to watch the
bulletin boards at some broker&rsquo;s, but he
would hardly have been the fanciful dreamer
he was, had he not shrunk from actually
coming in contact with men and the reality
of the business at which he played.</p>

<p>For a week this absurdity continued. Sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
West gained a little in his visionary
speculations, and this inspired him with new
courage, although whether he won or lost he
was still possessed with the fatal gambling
mania. His work meanwhile was not advancing.
It is true that he sat for hours at
his table nominally at work upon his play,
but he interrupted himself constantly to consider
whether there were not some way of recovering
the money he had lost.</p>

<p>When Saturday night came he looked back
over his week with regret and shame. The
date fixed for his presenting his sketch to the
manager was now only eight days off, and he
was practically no further advanced in his
preparation than on the day when his friend
brought him the delightful news that that
elusive personage had consented to make
the appointment. He had wasted the past
week in a foolish day-dream, as profitless as
it was absurd. Yet he smiled to himself at
the reflection that his day-dream had at least
been amusing. It had been like creating a
story or the plot for a play; and with a characteristically
bachelor thought, he added to
himself that it was at least less dangerous
to play with visions of fortune than of love,
and quite as sensible.</p>

<p>He could not, on the whole, however, be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
satisfied with the result of his week, and he
determined to have no more of this folly.
He must set to work in earnest, and he resented
the consciousness which forced itself
upon him that his lonely life and imaginative
turn made it possible for him to fall into vagaries
which to the practical common-sense of
mankind in general would be held to indicate
anything but a sound mind. He started up
suddenly and gathered all the papers upon
which were recorded his unlucky stock transactions,
and began to thrust them into the
stove. He would make an end of the whole
foolish business. And yet, so far from entirely
burning his ships, he at least left for
himself a little boat in which to continue his
explorations into the delusive regions of
financial fairy-land, since he saved the one
slip which contained the statement of the
present condition of his much-diminished
fortune. He condescended to the weak, but
eminently human trick of attempting to humbug
himself in regard to his reasons for doing
so. He said to himself, exactly as if he were
explaining to another person, that the bit of
paper would serve as a warning to him,
should he ever be tempted to indulge in so
idiotic a diversion again; and he added, as if
to quiet the least suspicion that he meant to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
use the memorandum, that the morrow being
Sunday there would be no market with which
he could play.</p>

<p>And yet, so weak is human resolution, such
a rope of sand is it to fetter the resistless
progress of character,&mdash;which is destiny,&mdash;that
the next evening found West with the
Sunday paper spread before him, carefully
studying the financial article, and elaborating
his plans for a grand <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup</i>, by which he
should regain all the thousands he had lost.
He had become very canny during the week&rsquo;s
study of the market reports, and he felt this
Sunday evening all the pleasant satisfaction
of one who, out of sight, cunningly devises
the overthrow of clever enemies. On Monday
morning he would&mdash;in imagination, of
course&mdash;go into the field with a shrewdly
devised scheme of buying and selling, which
should result in the triumphant re-establishment
of his financial standing. When one is
dealing with life in imagination merely there
is of course no limit to the extent to which
one may make himself master of events; and
partly from a keen fancy, partly from pure
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">naïveté</i>, West&rsquo;s plan involved nothing less than
bulling the market himself upon his visionary
capital, now shrunken to some $70,000.</p>

<p>All day Monday West was in a state of excitement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
which was amazingly absurd when
one considers that the cause was wholly
fancy. When a drunkard returns to his cups
he is notoriously more intemperate than before,
and in delivering himself up for a second
time to the intoxication of his vagaries
Barum plunged more recklessly than ever
into its extravagances. On Tuesday he was
once more to be rich, and then he would
speculate no more. Safe mortgages and
government bonds should suffice him as investments,
even though the rate of interest
they paid was low. He would not again expose
himself to the chances of such feverish
excitement as that in which he had spent the
past week.</p>

<p>So real had the whole business become to
him that, while he smiled at his own folly
as he took up the Tuesday evening paper,
he actually felt a pang of disappointment to
discover that his imaginary operations had
produced no effect on the stock market. So
far from rising, stocks had that day gone almost
out of sight, so great had been the fall
in the price of securities of all sorts.</p>

<p>A feeling almost of despair came over the
young man as he read. He had gone out
into the street to buy the earliest edition
which would contain the account of the sales<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
that day, and as he walked toward his attic
he experienced almost as sharp a pang as if
the absolute wreck which he found had overtaken
his imaginary fortune had befallen a
genuine bank-account. That unreasonable
youthful disappointment which arises from
a sense of failure <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">per se</i>, with little reference
to the real importance of the stake, stung him
keenly; and he was one of those men who cannot
but confound real and æsthetic grievances.</p>

<p>He returned to his attic and figured it out.
He was absolutely and hopelessly ruined.
He had not only lost every dollar of his
imaginary fortune, but he was, on paper,
some seven or eight hundred dollars in debt
to his brokers for commissions. He was so
overwhelmed by this catastrophe that he sat
brooding over it in the darkness of the February
twilight and gathering night, until it
was far past the hour when he usually took
his apology for a dinner. He was not without
a sense of humor sufficiently vivid to
make him laugh at himself, and mentally
mock at the vexation which the result of
his airy speculations caused him; but this
did not prevent his being vexed, or take
his thoughts from laborious calculations how
a different result might have been reached.
He went off to dinner at last with a sober<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
and abstracted mien, ordering a repast even
more economical than usual, as befitted one
who had just lost his whole fortune in ill-starred
speculation.</p>

<p>It was his custom to time his visit to the
restaurant so as to dine before the crowd
of customers came for their evening meal.
To-night, however, he was behind them.
The place was no fuller than he usually
found it, but it bore signs of the recent
crush. The cloth of the table was crumpled
and soiled, the glass in which the inevitable
ice-water was poured was yet warm from
being washed, while the evening paper the
waiter gave him was adorned with an irregular
stain of coffee. In the midst of the brown
blotch of this stain was a patch undiscolored;
and by one of those odd and improbable coincidences
of which life is full, in the midst
of this spot of dingy white Barum West once
more caught sight of his own name. The
whimsical fate which had started the fantastic
train of thought in his mind ten days before
now finished its work by a paragraph stating
that the will by which $200,000 had been
bequeathed to Barum West by Richard Granger,
of Chicago, was now found to antedate
a second testament by which the money was
left to Harvard College.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>Barum West went home with the light step
of a boy. A great responsibility seemed suddenly
lifted from his shoulders. The capricious
fancy which had insisted that he should
be depressed because he had lost an imaginary
fortune had apparently been willing to
accept the fact that even in hypothesis the
possession of the money had been a mistake,
and the unlucky speculator was formally acquitted
at the bar of his inner consciousness.
He lit his lamp and his pipe, seated himself
in his chintz-covered rocking-chair, with his
heels on the top of the coal stove, and ruminated.
He reflected upon the fact that it
was only five days before he was to meet
the manager, and nothing was done in the
way of a play which he could for an instant
regard as at all satisfactory.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Instead of writing an extravaganza,&rdquo; he
thought, with mingled amusement and self-reproach,
&ldquo;I have been living one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The form of the thought struck him instantly.
His feet came down to the floor
with a crash, and in his excitement his pipe
went smashing down beside them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; he cried aloud, &ldquo;I have it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the plot of the extravaganza, which
everybody will remember as being so successful
the following winter, &ldquo;A Speculator<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
in Air,&rdquo; and which set Barum West on his
feet financially, was only a properly modified
version of the vagaries in which the author
had indulged in the handling and the losing
of his imaginary fortune.</p>

<h2>A BUSINESS MEETING.</h2>


<p>[<i>Certain absurd, not to say malicious, reports having
been circulated in regard to the meeting held by
the Rosedale Sewing-Circle to decide upon the time,
place, and other details of their annual spring fair, it
is deemed but simple justice to the estimable ladies who
compose that body to give an accurate and unvarnished
account of the proceedings on that occasion; and the
writer feels that not only will such a narration sufficiently
silence all slanders, but that it will as well
go far toward a triumphant refutation of the often-repeated
falsehood that women have no aptitude for
business.</i>]</p>

<p>The meeting, being appointed for 2.30 <span class="f8">P.&nbsp;M.</span>,
was called to order by the president, Mrs. Gilflora
Smithe, at 3.30 <span class="f8">P.&nbsp;M.</span>, the hour preceding having
been spent in an animated and pleasant discussion
of the important question whether the pastor&rsquo;s
wife, who was detained at home by illness, was
really so extravagant as to use granulated sugar in
her sweet pickles, as was positively asserted by
Miss Araminta Sharp. The secretary read the
report of the last meeting, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Monday, April 7.&mdash;Meeting called to order
by the president. The records read and approved.
There being no quorum present, it was unanimously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
voted to hold the next meeting on Thursday,
as that day is more convenient for the ladies.
On motion of Mrs. Percy Browne, voted to appoint
a committee of one to take charge of the
Art Department of the fair. Mrs. Browne kindly
volunteered to serve as that committee. Adjourned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The records having been approved, the president
remarked that there was so much business to
come before the meeting that she really could not
tell where to begin, and she should be glad if some
one would make a motion, just to start things.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A motion to put things in motion,&rdquo; murmured
Miss Keene, looking around with the smile which
everybody knew meant that she had made a joke.</p>

<p>Everybody smiled also, although nobody saw
the point until the president echoed, with a pleased
air of discovery, &ldquo;Motion,&mdash;motion! Very good,
Miss Keene.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then they all smiled once again, and Miss Gray
told of an excellent jest made by a cousin in
Boston:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My cousin in Boston&mdash;that is, she isn&rsquo;t my
real cousin, but a step-cousin by marriage&mdash;was
at a concert once, and she made an awfully good
joke. I don&rsquo;t remember exactly now what it was,
but it was awfully funny. It was something about
music, and we all laughed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t seem to me,&rdquo; spoke up Miss Sharp,
acidly, &ldquo;that Boston jokes will help the fair much;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
and I move you, Mrs. President,&mdash;if I don&rsquo;t make
a motion, I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know who ever will,&mdash;that
the fair be held on the 20th of April.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I second the motion,&rdquo; promptly spoke up Miss
Snob, who always seconded everything.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is moved and seconded,&rdquo; said the president,
&ldquo;that the fair be held on the 20th of April; but
I&rsquo;m sure the 23d would suit me a great deal
better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not have it the 17th?&rdquo; asked Miss Keene;
&ldquo;that seems to me quite late enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear, no,&rdquo; interrupted Mrs. Percy Browne,
&ldquo;I never could get half the things done for my
department by that time. I move we have it the
30th.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Second the motion,&rdquo; promptly responded Miss
Snob.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is moved and seconded,&rdquo; propounded Mrs.
Smithe from the chair, &ldquo;that the fair be held on
the 30th. That seems to me an excellent time.
If it be your minds, you will please to signify it.
It is a vote.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I still stick to the 20th,&rdquo; declared Miss Sharp,
viciously. &ldquo;I shall open my candy-table then,
whether the rest of the fair is ready or not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sweets to the sweet,&rdquo; murmured Miss Keene,
looking around with her jest-announcing smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The 20th is Sunday, any way,&rdquo; observed the
Hon. Mrs. Sampson Hoyt, in tones of great condescension.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; persisted the contumacious
Sharp. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have my part of the fair then, any
way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose we compromise,&rdquo; suggested the president,
pacifically, &ldquo;and say the 25th.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was considerable discussion, more or less
acrimonious, at this proposition, but it was finally
adopted without the formality of a vote, the secretary
being instructed to set the date April 25th
down as the final decision of the meeting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There will have to be a general committee of
arrangements,&rdquo; the president observed, this important
preliminary having been settled. &ldquo;I suppose
it is customary for the chair to appoint them;
but I am ready to receive nominations.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I nominate Miss Keene,&rdquo; said Mrs. Browne,
who wished to keep in that lady&rsquo;s good graces.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Second the motion,&rdquo; Miss Snob exclaimed,
with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Keene will have enough to do at the
cake-table,&rdquo; Mrs. Smithe replied. &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll
appoint Mrs. Hoyt, Mrs. Crowler, Mrs. Henderson,
and Mrs. Lowell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s never but three on that committee,&rdquo;
snapped Miss Sharp. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to take off
one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; responded Mrs. Smithe, in dismay;
&ldquo;I think you must be mistaken.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Miss Sharp persisted, and the president,
driven into a corner, was forced to propose that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
one of the ladies named should resign. Nobody
seemed willing to do this, however, and it was at
length decided that some one of the four should
regard herself as a substitute, to act in case one of
the others could not serve. The president could
not, however, bring herself to specify which should
be the substitute, and was greatly relieved when
the conversation was turned by Mrs. Henderson&rsquo;s
remarking,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Speaking of substitutes reminds me. Did you
know that you could make mince-pies without
meat? My niece from Bangor&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>[<i>The talk of the next fifteen minutes is omitted, as
being irrelevant, relating exclusively to cooking. At
the expiration of that time, the business of the occasion
was accidentally reintroduced by an allusion on the
part of Mrs. Crowler to some delicious chocolate macaroons
which she had eaten at a fair in East Machias.</i>]</p>

<p>&ldquo;We really must have some more committees,&rdquo;
the president said, recovering herself with a start.
&ldquo;Will somebody make a motion?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think Friday is a good day for a fair,
any way,&rdquo; Mrs. Lowell now remarked, reflectively.
&ldquo;The 25th is Friday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I never thought of that,&rdquo; exclaimed half a
dozen ladies, in dismay. &ldquo;We should be all tired
out for baking-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what we can do,&rdquo; the president
said, in despairing accents,&mdash;&ldquo;there seem to be
so many days, and only one fair; and we&rsquo;ve had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
so many dates proposed. We shall have to unvote
something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was at this crisis that the Hon. Mrs. Sampson
Hoyt rose to the heights of the parliamentary
opportunity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I move the previous question,&rdquo; she said, distinctly
and firmly.</p>

<p>There fell a hush of awe over the sewing-circle,
and even Miss Snob was a moment in bringing out
her second.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think!&rdquo; Mrs. President Smithe ventured,
a little falteringly, &ldquo;that I quite understood
the motion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I moved,&rdquo; the Hon. Mrs. Hoyt replied, with
the air of one conscious that her husband had
once been almost nominated to the State Legislature,
and had been addressed as Honorable ever
after, &ldquo;I moved the previous question.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; Mrs. Smithe said, inquiringly and
pleadingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That takes everything back to the beginning,&rdquo;
Mrs. Hoyt condescended to explain, &ldquo;and we can
then change the date of our fair in a strictly legal
way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She threw a glance of superb scorn around her
as she spoke, and even Miss Sharp took on a
subdued and corrected air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is moved and seconded the previous question,&rdquo;
Mrs. Smithe propounded, with an air of
great relief. &ldquo;It is a vote.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we had better do away with
everything in this case,&rdquo; Mrs. Hoyt observed, with
a smile of gracious concession. &ldquo;We might let
the committee of arrangements stand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That she&rsquo;s chairman of,&rdquo; whispered Mrs.
Crowler, spitefully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember,&rdquo; observed Miss Sharp,
gazing into futurity with an air of abstraction,
&ldquo;that there is anything in the by-laws about the
previous question.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A flutter stirred the entire company. The
ladies looked at each other, and then with one
accord turned their regards upon the Hon. Mrs.
Hoyt, as one who, having got them into this
difficulty, was in honor bound to help them out
of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I supposed everybody knew,&rdquo; that lady remarked,
with icy sweetness, &ldquo;that the rules of
making motions do not have to be in the by-laws.
They are in&rdquo;&mdash;the speaker hesitated, not being
exactly sure of the title of the volume to which
her husband had given so careful attention when
expecting to be nominated: feeling, however, that
anything was better than the appearance of ignorance,
she went on precipitately&mdash;&ldquo;in &lsquo;Pole&rsquo;s
Manual.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Even Miss Sharp had no retort adequate to
meet this crushing appeal to authority, not being
sufficiently well informed to connect Pole with
whist, so she contented herself by observing, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
a sniff, that for her part she was glad she did not
know so much as some people pretended to.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It does seem to me,&rdquo; observed Mrs. Henderson,
at this point, &ldquo;that we might let this one
year go by without a fair. There&rsquo;s been so much
sickness in Rosedale this winter that everybody is
tired out, and we had a great deal better wait till
June, and have a strawberry-festival. I move we
put the whole thing off till then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Second the motion,&rdquo; cried Miss Snob, with
great promptitude.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot consent to put that motion,&rdquo; the president
said, with great dignity. &ldquo;We have made
up our minds to have a fair now, and we might
as well have it, and be done with it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I move,&rdquo; Mrs. Browne put in sweetly, with the
intention of suiting everybody, &ldquo;that we have a
fair <em>and</em> a strawberry-festival.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Snob seconded this motion with her customary
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is moved and seconded,&rdquo; the president said,
&ldquo;that we have a fair and a strawberry-festival.
But that seems a great deal; and I think I had
better declare it not a vote, unless doubted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nobody was clear about the effects of doubting
a negative proposition; but Mrs. Crowler was
pleased to observe, &ldquo;Well, any way, now I come
to think it over, I think, on the whole, I won&rsquo;t be
on the arrangements committee at all; but I&rsquo;ll be
chairman of the finance committee when that is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
fixed,&mdash;and that&rsquo;ll leave only three on the arrangements.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This moved Mrs. Henderson to resign, and Mrs.
Lowell following her example, Mrs. Hoyt was left
in solitary grandeur upon the committee.</p>

<p>Matters were not improved, moreover, when
Miss Keene remarked, &ldquo;If we&rsquo;ve voted &lsquo;the previous
question,&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t see but we&rsquo;ve still got to
fix the day. All that is undone now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; responded the Hon. Mrs. Sampson
Hoyt, with the virtuous joy of an iconoclast gazing
on the ruin he has wrought.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t seem to have anything exactly fixed,&rdquo;
the president said, with a helpless and conciliatory
smile. &ldquo;If somebody would make a motion&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too late to make any more motions to-day,&rdquo;
Miss Sharp interrupted, with much vigor. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
ten minutes of six.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this announcement of the lateness of the
hour, the entire company started to their feet in
dismay; and although, when the president and
secretary tried next day to remember what had
been done, that the latter might make up her
report, they recorded that the meeting adjourned,
that statement must be regarded as having been
purely a parliamentary fiction, entered in the secretary&rsquo;s
book to gratify that instinct innate in
woman&rsquo;s breast to follow exactly the regular and
strictest forms of recognized rules of order.</p>

<div class="figleft">

</div>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Every</span> life has its history: this is
the story of Ruth Welch, the
placid-faced, silver-haired woman
who sat in the September twilight
looking out over the moorlands one Saturday
evening, and considering many things.</p>

<p>The house faced toward the south. It
looked across a little creek which made in
from the sea, and it had in its prospect only
level heaths to the horizon&rsquo;s edge. On the
west stretched the waters of an arm of the
Atlantic, and the tides came twice a day
around the low cape into the inlet, and the
wind blew over the moors; but in all directions
one looked upon level wastes,&mdash;&ldquo;the
plains,&rdquo; the country people called them,
speaking of them sometimes as &ldquo;Welch&rsquo;s
bogs,&rdquo; or in sections as the &ldquo;blueb&rsquo;ry plains,&rdquo;
or the &ldquo;cramb&rsquo;ry marshes;&rdquo; and people who
lived outside of them regarded the moors as
painfully dull.</p>

<p>They were not, too, without some excuse
for such an opinion. The rhodora and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
kalmia&mdash;the &ldquo;lamb-kill&rdquo;&mdash;in spring spread
over sections of the waste transient sheets of
glowing color, but for the most part the
country was either white or brown, and to
one not fond of it the effect of the monotone
of hue was depressing. The shade of brown
varied, changing from a grayish or even
greenish brown in midsummer to a sombre,
almost uniform umber in autumn, which latter
tint now and then during the winter appeared
in desolate patches through the flats of
snow, until in March the whole plain came to
light darker and more forbidding than ever.</p>

<p>All these long months the only break in
the low monochrome of the landscape was
the red cottage which still was called &ldquo;Gran&rsquo;sir&rsquo;
Welch&rsquo;s,&rdquo; although the old man had been
dead many a year, and the little garden before
it that kept up, with old-fashioned flowers,
a show of bravery until the frosts came.
The tint of the old house was dull and dingy,
but in so colorless a setting the hue seemed
brighter, as a single event might assume undue
importance in a monotonous life. If one
could have supposed the builder an imaginative
man or one given to refinements of sentiment,
it might be easy to imagine that when
he built his house thus alone in the plains,
with not another dwelling in sight and without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
a break in the level landscape, he felt the
need of giving it some color that should protest
against the deadly grayness of all around
and hearten its owner by its warmth of tone.</p>

<p>So overwhelming were the solitude and the
unbroken sameness of the place, however,
that an imaginative man would scarcely have
chosen it as an abiding-place, although once
involved in its powerful fascination he would
have been held to his life&rsquo;s end. By what
accident Gran&rsquo;sir&rsquo; Welch&rsquo;s grandfather had
chosen to build here, half a score of miles
from the little fishing village which stood to
the people of that region for the world, no
one knew, and very likely no one cared.
Folk thereabout concerned themselves little
with reasons for anything, facts being all they
found mental grasp sufficient to hold. Once
established in the plains, however, there was
no especial cause to suppose the family would
not continue to live on there until its course
was interrupted either by extinction or by
the arrival of the Judgment-Day.</p>

<p>Extinction was not very far off now, since
only this white-haired woman remained to
bear the name. Her mother had died in the
daughter&rsquo;s infancy. Mrs. Welch had never
adapted herself to the silence and loneliness
of the moors, and her people over at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
village declared that she had &ldquo;died of the
plains;&rdquo; and it is possible that they were
right. Ruth&rsquo;s father, when she was still but
a child, had been lost at sea; and the girl
had been cared for by her grandfather and
the old serving-woman Bethiah, who had once
been supposed to be a hired girl, but had
ended by being so thoroughly identified with
the family that her surname was wellnigh
forgotten, and she was designated, when she
was spoken of at all, as Bethiah Welch.</p>

<p>The child grew much in the same way as
grew the houseleeks in the boxes beside the
southern door, very slowly and dully. Once
or twice she went for a few months to stay
with an aunt in the village ten miles away, it
being the unanimous opinion of her relatives
that as the Welches always had known how
to read and write it was proper that something
should be done for Ruth&rsquo;s education;
and the village school was the only educational
means known in the region. The girl
pined for home, however, and was never content
away from the red house. Perhaps by a
strange perversity of circumstance the home-longing
of the mother was in the child transformed
into a clinging fondness for the place
where the former was so lonely and alien.
The low, level moors were necessary to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
Ruth&rsquo;s life; in their colorless monotony she
somehow found the complement for her uneventful
life. Perhaps the very dulness developed
her imagination, as special organs
appear in animals whose abnormal conditions
of existence render them needful. If this
were so, it was no less true that the moors
absorbed whatever mental life they stimulated,
until the girl seemed hardly less a part
of them than the knolls of leathery shrubs,
the scattered, shallow pools, the tufts of coarse
grass, or the whispering voices of the wind
which all night long and every night were hurrying
to and fro, concerned with unspeakable
tidings which perhaps came from the sea that
forever moaned along the moorland&rsquo;s edges.</p>

<p>Little conscious imagination had Ruth at
nineteen; and it was at nineteen that the
single, trifling event of her life occurred.
She was a maiden by no means uncomely.
She was not educated in any conventional
sense of the term; but her life alone with her
grandfather and old Bethiah and the great
brown moors had bred in her a certain sweet
gravity which was not without its charm,
had there been but those to see who could
appreciate it.</p>

<p>Along the front of the house ran a bench,
where people seldom sat, since there were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
none to sit, but where the milk-pans dried in
the sun, a gleaming row; and one sunny morning
late in September the flash of their shimmer
caught the eye of a skipper who in his
yacht in the bay studied the horizon with his
glass. He was not yet past those years when
a man still finds amusement in imitating fate
and nature by yielding to his impulses; the
gleam suggested pleasant draughts of fresh
milk; and without more ado, he headed the
trig little craft in which he and a brother
artist were skirting the coast of the Gulf of
Maine for the little inlet upon which Gran&rsquo;sir&rsquo;
Welch&rsquo;s red cottage stood.</p>

<p>In those days yachts were less common
than now, and both Ruth and Bethiah left
their work to watch the boat as it ran up to
the low wharf, and the snowy sail fell with a
musical rattle and clash of metallic rings.</p>

<p>The skipper, a stalwart young fellow, too
handsome by half, came briskly ashore and
did his errand, and while the old servant
went for the milk, stood with Ruth by the
open door asking idle questions, to which she
replied without either shyness or boldness.
His eyes were just on a level with hers as she
stood on the threshold above him, and their
bold, merry glance saw with full appreciation
how clear were her sherry-brown orbs. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
removed his cap and leaned against the
door-post, letting his glance stray over the
landscape. Here and there upon the brown
surface his keen eye detected the flame of a
scarlet leaf amid the prevailing russet, but the
combined effect of all the red leaves upon
the plain could not warm the sombre wastes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you get tired of the sameness?&rdquo;
he asked suddenly, as if the monotony all at
once seemed to him too great to be borne.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; Ruth answered, smiling faintly,
&ldquo;I like it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He brushed back his curly, golden locks
with a shapely brown hand, and regarded her
more closely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is like a fish in the water,&rdquo; was his
conclusion when he spoke again. &ldquo;It would
drown me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ruth smiled again, showing her white, even
teeth a little, although she did not in the
least understand what he meant; and before
the conversation could go further Bethiah
appeared with the milk she had been getting.
Ruth put aside the stranger&rsquo;s offer of pay,
and with an instinct of hospitality which must
have been genuine indeed to have survived
so long disuse from lack of opportunity, she
stepped down into the little garden-plot and
picked a nosegay of the old-fashioned flowers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
which in the southern exposure were still
unharmed by frost.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Put a posy in my button-hole,&rdquo; he requested
lightly, when she gave them to him.
&ldquo;Pick out the prettiest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She had never stuck a flower in a man&rsquo;s
coat, but she was too utterly devoid of self-consciousness
to be shy. She selected a
beautiful clove pink, and smiling her grave
smile, thrust the stem through the buttonhole
of his yachting-jacket as he held out
the lapel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would be just the color of your cheeks,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;if it could only get sunburned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A redder glow flushed up at his words,
and so tempting was the innocent face before
him that half involuntarily he bent forward
to kiss the smooth lips. The girl drew
back, in that grave, unemotional fashion of
hers which was to the stranger so unaccountable
at once and so fascinating, and he failed
of his intent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, well,&rdquo; he said, in nowise disconcerted,
&ldquo;keep the kiss for your sweetheart, but thank
you for the flowers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He laughed with a gleeful, deep-toned note,
and turned down the faintly-defined path to
the shore again.</p>

<p>Ruth looked on with interest at the hoisting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
of the sail; she smiled responsively as the
two mariners doffed their caps to her, and
then, regardless of the old superstition of the
ill-luck of watching people out of sight, she
kept her eyes fixed upon the pretty little
craft as it skimmed over the waters, as long
as it could be seen. Then she turned a comprehensive
glance over all her moors, as if to
to take them into confidence regarding the
pleasant incident which had just happened,
and returned to her interrupted domestic
duties. The interview had touched her with
no repinings; and even could she have known
that in that brief moment all the romance of
her life had been acted, she would scarcely
have sighed. She smiled as she went about
her homely occupations, and flushed a little
with the consciousness of innocent vanity as
she found herself glancing into the glass at
the reflection of her softly-glowing cheeks,
reddened with health and with the sun.</p>

<p>This September day was the single glowing
spot in the slow, mellow years of Ruth&rsquo;s
life. She came and went, slept and waked,
perhaps even dreamed. She was always in
a happy, contented repose among her moors,
becoming of them every day more and more
completely a part. The wide plains grew
green in spring with transient verdure, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
purple petals of the rhodora flushed through
their brief day and dropped into the shallow
brown pools left by the late rains in the
hollows; then all the waste turned to fawn
and russet under the suns of summer, and
the cycle of the year was completed by deepening
browns and the wide stretches of snow.
Now and again great rolling masses of mist
came up from the sea and hid wold and wave
alike from sight, but yet the sense of the
plains was like a presence to Ruth, as with
heart warm as an egg beneath the mother-bird&rsquo;s
breast, she went her way and lived her
span of life.</p>

<p>She was far from being dull in her feelings.
Indeed, for one in her station and surroundings,
she was unusually sensitive to mood of
shore and sky, to the beauty of the sunsets
or of the wild flowers which sprang amid
the low shrubs. She was simply content.
She was so perfectly in harmony with her
world that she could not be unhappy. She
grew as a bluebell grows. She was not deficient
in womanly sentiment. She thought
sometimes of the handsome sailor lad whose
bold brown eyes had looked into hers, and
she smiled anew with simple pleasure that he
had found her fair. She remembered the audacious
gleam which crossed his face when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
he bent forward to kiss her, and she did not
forget his words about a sweetheart. She
never spoke of her memories,&mdash;she came of
a reticent race, and neither Gran&rsquo;sir&rsquo; Welch
nor Bethiah was especially adapted to the
reception of confidences,&mdash;but she speculated
concerning the sweetheart she never
had, and of whose coming fate gave no sign.
There was never any tinge of melancholy in
these reflections. She accepted life too
simply to be sad, even with that vague oppression
which seemed to casual observers
the obvious consequence of the overpowering
presence of the wastes.</p>

<p>As years went on, she accepted the fact that
the time of dreams of love was past, and with
placid content she reflected that the shadow
of the ungiven kiss of the sailor would never
be disturbed by the pressure of lover&rsquo;s lips
upon hers.</p>

<p>It is between twenty and thirty that the
temperament of a woman becomes fixed, and
all her future irrevocably made or marred.
Before this her character is too flexible, after
this too rigid for impressions to be lasting.
During these years the peace of the wide,
calm, and sombre moorlands stamped indelibly
upon Ruth a sweet, grave content which
nothing could destroy or shake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>There came a time when into the calm of
the old house death rushed, with that dreadful
precipitancy which always marks his coming,
even when expected, and old Gran&rsquo;sir&rsquo; Welch,
long past fourscore, was, in the quaint language
of the King James version, gathered to
his fathers.</p>

<p>In the gray dawn Ruth tapped softly at the
hives of the bees which stood, straw-thatched,
against the eastern end of the cottage, and
announced the sad news, firmly believing
that unless within twelve hours the swarms
were told of death they would desert their
homes. Then in the sunny autumn afternoon
a funeral procession of boats trailed
from the red cottage to the graveyard behind
the church in the village, where slept such of
his forefathers as the sea had spared to die in
their beds. With evenly dipping oars went
first the quaintly-shaped pinky bearing the
coffin between two stout fisherman, one at
prow and one at stern; while after followed
the dories in which were the few nearer relatives
who had come to attend the services
at the house.</p>

<p>Ruth sat beside a cousin and listened half
unconsciously to the plash of the oars and
the rhythmic beat of the waves against the
boat, looking back with tear-dimmed eyes to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
the red house until it was by distance blended
with the dun country as the last spark dies
amid the ashes. She was sad, and she felt
that oppressive terror which the presence of
death brings; yet her calm was not seriously
or permanently shaken.</p>

<p>In their relentless, even course the years
moved on, and one day in spring, when the
rhodora was in all its glory, and the one bush
of mountain-laurel in the wide plains, which
had strayed into the heath like a lamb into
the wilderness, was as white in the distance
as a bunch of upland maybloom, again Ruth
went softly and gravely to tell the bees that
death had been in the red house, and the
procession of boats, like the Egyptian train
over the Lake of the Dead, bore away the
mortal remains of faithful old Bethiah.</p>

<p>Ruth&rsquo;s relatives in the village tried to induce
her now to come to them, and when she
could not be moved to do this, urged her at
least to have some one live with her. She
was getting to be an old woman, they said
among themselves, although in truth she was
little past fifty, and since for that part of the
world she was not ill-provided with worldly
goods, there was no lack of those who were
willing to take up their abode as her companion
in the red house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>Ruth put all offers aside,&mdash;kindly, indeed,
but decisively. She was pleased to live
alone; not from a misanthropic dislike of
her kind, but because it was so deep and
inexhaustible a delight to her to brood happily
among her plains. More and more she
loved these umber wastes, over which cloud-shadows
drifted like the darkening ripple of
the wind on the sea. She knew all their
ways, those mysterious paths which wind
between the hillocks of deserted heaths as if
worn with the constant passing of invisible
feet, and she was never weary of wandering
among the ragged hummocks, breathing in
the salt air from the sea and noting with
happy eyes all the weeds and wild flowers,
the shrubs that were too inconspicuous to be
singled out at a distance, but which to the
careful and loving observer revealed themselves
as full of beauty. She was fond of
the faint, sweet scents of the opening flowers
in spring, of the dying grass in fall, of the
burning peat when fires broke out sometimes
to smoulder until the next rain. She never
thought about her feelings or phrased the
matter to herself, but she loved so perfectly
these wastes which seemed so desolate that
they were to her as kindred and home; perhaps
even the maternal instinct which is inborn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
in every woman&rsquo;s breast found some
not quite inadequate expression in her almost
passionate fondness for the great heath.</p>

<p>Her relatives spoke of her always as &ldquo;odd,&rdquo;
and were aggrieved that her ways should be
different from theirs; but everything that
continues comes in time to be accepted,
and as the years went on Ruth&rsquo;s method of
life came to seem proper because it had so
long been the same. A brawny armed fisher
cousin sailed over from the village every Sunday
morning to see that all was well at the
red house, and to bring whatever might be
needed from the village store. Sometimes
in winter he found her house half buried
in snow, but he never could report that she
appeared either discontented or sad.</p>

<p>It was of the coming of this emissary that
Ruth was thinking on this Saturday night
in September where first this record found
her. She had been reflecting much to-day
about dying. In her walk about the heath
she had come upon a dead bird, and the
sight had suggested to her her own end.
She acknowledged to herself that she was
old, and for perhaps the only time in her life
her thought had formulated a general truth.
She had regarded the tiny corpse at her feet,
and then, looking about upon the moors, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
came over her how immortal is the youth of
the world and how brief is man&rsquo;s life. The
land about her was no older than when she
had looked upon it with baby eyes. For a
single instant a poignant taste of bitterness
seemed set to her lips; then in a moment the
very wide, changeless plain that had caused
her pain seemed itself somehow to assuage it.</p>

<p>To-night sitting here she admitted to herself
that her strength had failed somewhat
of late. Yes, she was old. It was almost
half a century ago that that bold-eyed handsome
stranger had compared the color in
her cheeks to a clove pink. She smiled
serenely, although her reflections were of
age and death, so perfectly did she recall
the sunny day and the air with which the
sailor would have kissed her. Placid and
content in the gathering dusk, she smiled
her own grave, sweet smile, which it were
scarcely too fanciful to liken to the odor of
the clove pink of her garden-plot whose hue
half a century ago had been in her cheek.
She had but one regret in leaving life, and
that was to leave her moorlands. She had
found existence so pleasant and had been so
well content that she could not understand
why people so usually spoke of life as sad;
but she could not think without pain of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
leaving the plains behind and going away
to lie in the bleak hillside graveyard where
slept her kinsfolk. It had never occurred
to her before to consider to which she held
more strongly, her people or the wide brown
stretches of open about her, but to-night
she debated it with herself and decided
it. She resolved to say to her cousin tomorrow
that she wished her grave made in
the plains. Very likely her relatives would
object. They had always thought her ideas
strange; but they would surely let her have
her way in this. She would even make some
concessions and perhaps let Cousin Sarah
come to live with her if they would agree
to do as she wished about this. It would be
so great a comfort to her to be assured that
she was not in death to be separated from
her dearly loved moors. She liked Sarah
well enough, only that it was so pleasant
to live alone with her bees and the plains.
Besides, if she should chance to die alone,
who would tell the bees? It would be a
pity to have the fine swarms lost.</p>

<p>Suddenly she started up in the dusk, and
without knowing clearly why she did it, she
wrote on the bottom of the list of errands
which she always made on Saturday for her
cousin her wish concerning her grave. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
spot she mentioned was a knoll near the
house, where the ground rose a little before
it dipped into the sea. She reflected as
she wrote that it was wiser to be prepared
for whatever could happen, and, although
she would not own it frankly even in these
lonely musings, Ruth had felt strangely
weak and worn to-day.</p>

<p>She frugally blew out the candle when her
writing was done, and with calm content sat
down again in her rocking-chair by the window
darkening to &ldquo;a glimmering square.&rdquo; She
heard the sound of the sea and the low wind
blowing over the wide plains; and, lulled by
the soft sounds, she fell at last asleep.</p>

<p>The wind rose in the night, and it was
afternoon when the cousin from the village
came in sight of the red house. No smoke
rose from its chimney, and as he tied his
clumsy sail-boat to the low wharf where so
long ago a yacht had been briefly fastened,
a long wavering line of bees rose glistening
from the straw-thatched hives, floating upward
and away like the departing soul of
mortal. Their mistress had been dead more
than twelve hours and they had not been
told. Perhaps it was a chance flight; perhaps
they were seeking her serene spirit over the
moors she loved so well.</p>

<h2>THIRTEEN.</h2>


<p>[<i>The drawing-room of Mr. Sylvanus Potts Thompson,
banker. Mr. Thompson and his wife, with ten
guests, making a neat round dozen in all, are waiting
the announcement of dinner. Enter Mr. Sylvanus
Potts, a wealthy uncle from the country.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Mr. Potts.</i> I told the man there was no need to
announce me; you knew I was coming next week,
and a few days don&rsquo;t matter. How do you do,
nephew? how do you do, Jane?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Thompson.</i> Why, uncle, we did not expect
you so soon, but we are always glad to see you,
of course.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Thompson.</i> Yes, always, dear Uncle Sylvanus.
How is everybody at home?</p>

<p><i>Mr. P.</i> Oh, they&rsquo;re all well; you seem to be
having a party, nephew?</p>

<p><i>Mr. T.</i> Only a few friends to dinner. Let me
introduce you.</p>

<p>[<i>He takes him on his arm and presents him to his
guests. While this is being done, a sentimental, elderly
young woman, with thin curls, after whispering
impressively with her neighbor, glides up to the hostess,
and holds a moment&rsquo;s conversation with that lady.
Mrs. Thompson turns pale, and seems engaged in a
mental calculation. Then she starts quickly toward
her husband and draws him aside</i>]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> Sylvanus, do you know how many
people there are in this room?</p>

<p><i>Mr. T.</i> Oh, about a dozen, I suppose.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> About a dozen! There are thirteen,
Sylvanus, thirteen!</p>

<p><i>Mr. T.</i> Well, what of it?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> What of it! Why, we can&rsquo;t sit down
to dinner with thirteen at table. Maria Smith says
she should have a fit.</p>

<p><i>Mr. T.</i> But she wouldn&rsquo;t, my dear; she&rsquo;s too
fond of her dinner.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> Mr. Thompson, is it kind to speak so
of my most particular friend?</p>

<p><i>Mr. T.</i> But what does Maria expect us to do
about it? Turn Uncle Sylvanus out of the house?
Wasn&rsquo;t I named for him, and haven&rsquo;t I always
been his favorite? Do you want me to be left out
of his will?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> But something must be done. Don&rsquo;t
you see everybody is whispering and counting?
Can&rsquo;t we get somebody else?</p>

<p><i>Servant</i> (<i>who has entered unperceived</i>). There
is a man downstairs, sir, wants you to sign something.</p>

<p><i>Mr. T.</i> Ah, my dear, here&rsquo;s the very man,&mdash;young
Jones. He&rsquo;s our new cashier, and a very
clever fellow.</p>

<p>[<i>Exit Mr. Thompson. During his absence Mrs.
Thompson communicates to Miss Smith the solution
of the difficulty at which they have arrived. Everybody<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
has soon heard of it, so that on Mr. Thompson&rsquo;s
return with Mr. Jones, the pair are greeted with much
joking about the ill-luck which is thus averted. The
necessary introductions take place.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Mr. Jones.</i> I am sure I am rejoiced at being
instrumental in bringing good luck.</p>

<p><i>Miss Smith.</i> You can certainly see how welcome
you are, Mr. Jones.</p>

<p><i>Mr. J.</i> But I fear it is not for myself, Miss
Smith.</p>

<p><i>Miss S.</i> That will undoubtedly come later, when
we know you better.</p>

<p><i>Mr. P.</i> I am glad you found somebody, nephew;
for I must say I never would have given up my dinner
for a foolish superstition; and as I came last
and uninvited&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> (<i>relieved of her fears and remembering
the will</i>) You are always invited to this house,
Uncle Potts; and we would never hear of your
going away.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Robinson.</i> Well, it is all very well to call it
a superstition, you know; but I knew&mdash;</p>

<p>[<i>Mr. Robinson proceeds to narrate a grewsome and
melancholy tale, in which disaster and death resulted
from the imprudence of sitting down with thirteen at
table; half a dozen other guests begin simultaneously
the relation of six more equally or even more grewsome
and melancholy tales upon the same subject, when
they are interrupted by the arrival of a note for Mr.
Robinson.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Mr. R.</i> My dear Mrs. Thompson, I am so sorry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
but my brother has telegraphed for me to come to
him at once on a matter of the utmost importance.
I regret&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> But Mr. Robinson, don&rsquo;t you see that&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Servant.</i> Dinner is served.</p>

<p><i>Mr. T.</i> May I have the honor, Mrs. Brown?</p>

<p><i>Miss S.</i> But we can&rsquo;t go to dinner now. Mr.
Robinson is called away, and that leaves us thirteen
again.</p>

<p>[<i>An awful hush ensues, during which Mr. Robinson,
finding himself regarded as a criminal, suddenly
slips away, leaving the company to extricate
themselves from their trying situation as best they can.
The hush is followed by a Babel of voices, in which all
sorts of suggestions are made.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Mr. J.</i> (<i>with heroic and renunciatory self-denial</i>)
Let me speak, please, Mrs. Thompson. It
was very kind in your husband to invite me to
remain to dinner, but now that I shall be the
thirteenth, I am sure you&rsquo;ll excuse me.</p>

<p><i>Mr. T.</i> But it seems so inhospitable.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> But it is more generous to deprive
ourselves of Mr. Jones&rsquo;s company than to be the
means of bringing ill-luck upon him.</p>

<p><i>Mr. J.</i> Quite right. I bid you good evening,
Mrs. Thompson. I sincerely hope nothing further
will occur to mar the pleasure of your evening.</p>

<p>[<i>Mr. Jones having retired, a move is at once made
toward the dining-room, but just as Mr. Thompson
and Mrs. Brown reach the drawing-room door, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
are confronted by Mr. Robinson, who comes in breathless
but triumphant.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Mr. R.</i> I thought it was so unkind of me to
throw all your arrangements into confusion after
the ill-luck of numbers you have already had, that
I concluded to telegraph to my brother instead of
going. Phew! How I have hurried! I am glad
I am in time.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Brown.</i> Mr. Thompson, I positively cannot
sit down at table with thirteen. My aunt died of
it, and my second cousin. I am positive it runs
in the family, and I know I should be the one to
bear the consequence if we had thirteen at any
table where I sat down.</p>

<p>[<i>The greatest confusion follows. Miss Maria
Smith is heard to declare that <span class="nrm">&ldquo;Fate takes delight
in persecuting her!&rdquo;</span> while young Algernon White
mumbles something which has a distinct flavor of the
Apostles&rsquo; Creed. Mr. Robinson shows a disposition
to consider himself a most ill-used individual, thus
to be rewarded for the trouble he has taken.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Mr. T.</i> My dear, what shall we do now?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> There is only one thing that I can
think of; we can send across the street for Widow
Ellis. You might go yourself and explain to her
how it is.</p>

<p>[<i>This suggestion being acted upon, the company
settles into a solemn gloom, pending the return of the
host with Widow Ellis. Every one knows the dinner
will be spoiled, none being more acutely conscious of
that fact than the hostess, and every one is nearly perishing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
with hunger. More grewsome and melancholy
stories are told, but in a wavering and subdued manner,
as if they are being offered as excuses for resisting
the cravings of appetite, which are rapidly becoming
insupportable. Young White is heard to mutter, with
fresh suspicions of theological terms, that one might as
well die of thirteen at table as of starvation, and that
for his part he prefers the former method of extinction.
The return of Mr. Thompson with the Widow Ellis
awakens some feeble enthusiasm, but it is evident that
nothing short of a substantial dinner can restore the
spirits of the company.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Mr. P.</i> Well, nephew, now I hope we may
have some dinner. I, for one, am faint with
hunger.</p>

<p><i>Mr. T.</i> Oh, immediately. Mrs. Brown, we&mdash;</p>

<p>[<i>At this juncture poor Mrs. Thompson, overcome
with anxiety, fatigue, and hunger, produces a diversion
by falling in a dead faint. The shrieks of Miss
Maria Smith are re-enforced by those of other ladies of
the company, and it is to be feared that Mr. Algernon
White no longer enjoys the exclusive privilege of indulging
in ecclesiastical references. The excitement
usual upon such occasions reigns, and when at length
Mrs. Thompson is restored to consciousness, but is
found to be too ill to stand, and is borne off to her
chamber, the company, once more reduced to thirteen,
distributes itself in a stricken and overwhelmed state
about the drawing-room, with the air of having ceased
to struggle against an adverse fate.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Widow E.</i> We are thirteen again, neighbor;
and if you&rsquo;ll excuse me&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mr. P.</i> Thirteen or no thirteen, nephew, I&rsquo;m
going to have something to eat if it&rsquo;s in this house.</p>

<p>[<i>He disappears toward the dining-room, and as
the resolution of Widow Ellis seems to have solved
once more the dreadful conundrum of the fated number,
the company hastily follow, too nearly famished
to notice that the lady does not carry out her apparent
intention of returning home, so that after all they sit
down thirteen at table.</i>]</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/drop_i.jpg" width="61" height="62" alt="I" title="I" />
</div>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">It</span> was fortunate that when the editor
of the &ldquo;Dark Red&rdquo; magazine first
did me the honor to request a
story from my pen, I had one
ready for him, and one, moreover, with which
I was so well satisfied. I had so long vainly
desired to be really asked for a contribution,
and thus raised from the numerous and indiscriminate
company of scribblers who send
hopeful manuscripts to the magazines, and in
trembling uncertainty await the issue, that it
is not strange my bosom swelled with gratified
pride, and that I dispatched my copy with so
perfect a sense of complacency that I almost
seemed to condescend a little in letting the
editor have it.</p>

<p>I was fond of that story. I experienced a
certain delight in recalling the circumstances
under which it was composed, and I felt in it
that confidence which an author is sure to
have in work which has sprung spontaneously,
and as it were full-grown, from his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
brain. Every literary worker, down to the
veriest penny-a-liner of them all, knows the
difference between a tale which makes itself,
so to speak, growing unforced into beauty
and completeness like a crystal, and a laboriously
constructed piece of work, be it contrived
never so ingeniously and cleverly. The
fiction I sent to the editor of the &ldquo;Dark Red&rdquo;
was of the former variety. It had come into
my head all of itself, as the children say,
while I was travelling between New York and
Boston, so complete and so distinct that I
scarcely seemed to have more to do with its
creation than the later putting upon paper.</p>

<p>The circumstances were these:&mdash;</p>

<p>I had reached the Grand Central Station
just in time to catch the morning train; and
as the cars swept out into the daylight, I
settled myself into a seat with a comfortable
and something too self-satisfied feeling.
In the first place, I was glad to be out of
New York,&mdash;partly because it was hot and
dusty there, partly because I am not over-fond
of Gotham, and partly because sundry
pleasant bachelor friends and divers good
times were awaiting me at the Boston end
of the journey.</p>

<p>I looked out upon the sunny landscape,
over which the splendors of an April day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
cast a glow of warmth and brightness, smiled
at the remembrance of a retort I had made
at the Century Club on the previous evening,
which seemed to me rather neat, and then
with a sort of mental nod of farewell to all
the outside world I took up my book and
prepared to follow the fortunes of the woful
and wicked, but thoroughly charming French
heroine with whose adventures I was at that
particular time occupying myself. To my
vexation, however, I discovered that instead
of the second volume I had taken the first,
and as I had no especial desire to peruse
again the somewhat detailed account of the
heroine&rsquo;s youth, her career at school, her first
confession and early marriage,&mdash;all these
being preliminary to the impropriety and the
interest of the book, which, after the reprehensible
manner of French novels, began
together,&mdash;I laid down the volume with a
sigh, and resigned myself to a ride of unalleviated
dulness.</p>

<p>A resource instantly presented itself, however,
in the page which the lady in the seat
before me was reading. As I glanced up I
saw that she was entertaining herself with
poetry, and the next moment a familiar line
caught my eye:&mdash;</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;If you were April&rsquo;s lady, and I were lord of May.&rdquo;<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></div></div></div>

<p>&ldquo;Swinburne,&rdquo; I mused, &ldquo;or a collection of
selected poems, perhaps. Wiseacres would
say one ought to know what a reader is like
by the book she reads; but in the first place
that&rsquo;s nonsense, and in the second place I
don&rsquo;t know what book she is reading. She
has an exquisite ear, and her hair is something
bewildering. &lsquo;If you were April&rsquo;s lady.&rsquo;
April&rsquo;s lady should be a capricious creature,
all smiles and tears, with winning ways and
wilful wiles,&mdash;impulsive and wayward, and
thoroughly enchanting. It would not,&rdquo;&mdash;my
thoughts ran on in a professional turn, while
my eyes dwelt appreciatively, if somewhat
presumptuously, upon the lovely curve of my
neighbor&rsquo;s neck,&mdash;&ldquo;it would not be a bad
notion to write a story of such a maiden and
call it &lsquo;April&rsquo;s Lady.&rsquo; Let me see, what
should it be like?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And upon this impulse I fell to pondering,
when suddenly, as if by magic, a tale presented
itself all complete in my mind. My
mental action appeared to me more like that
of remembering than of creating, so real and
so complete was the pretty history. The self-willed,
volatile damsel whose fortunes it concerned
seemed one whom I had known, and
whom I might meet again some day. In
my mind she assumed, it is true, an outward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
semblance similar to that of the lady before
me, upon whose back I fixed my regards in
an absorbed stare, which should have disturbed
her could looks make themselves felt.
She did not move, however, and as she did
not turn the leaf of her book, I fancied she
might have fallen into a reverie as deep as
my own. I had not been able fully to see
her face, although a lucky turn had given me
a glimpse of a profile full of character and
beauty, and which made me desire to behold
more. I did not, however, trouble myself
about the exact details of my heroine&rsquo;s features,
since every story-teller has a stock of
choice personal charms with which to endow
his fictitious children, but continued to gloat
over my little romance; and so vividly was
the tale of &ldquo;April&rsquo;s Lady&rdquo; impressed upon
my mind that although some weeks elapsed
before I found time to put it upon paper,
I had not the slightest difficulty in recalling
even its most trifling incidents.</p>

<p>Almost the whole of my journey was taken
up in turning the story over in my mind,
and when we drew into the Boston station,
and my neighbor closed her volume to begin
the collection of her numerous feminine possessions,
I had half a mind to lean forward
and thank her for having given me, although
unconsciously, so good a story.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<p>It did seem to me, even after I had sent
my manuscript off and the dreadful moment
came when one realizes that it is too late
to make changes and consequently thinks
of plenty of things he wishes to alter, that
&ldquo;April&rsquo;s Lady&rdquo; was the best work I had
ever done. I had let a month or two pass
between its first writing and the final revision,
and I was pretty well satisfied that I had produced
a really capital story. I fondly hoped
Mr. Lane, the editor of the &ldquo;Dark Red,&rdquo; would
be moved by its excellence to give me further
orders; and the eagerness with which I one
morning tore open an envelope upon which
I recognized his handwriting, may be easily
enough imagined, at least by members of the
literary guild. My impatience gave place to
profound astonishment as I read the following
note:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
<span class="dat1">Office Dark Red Magazine</span>,<br />
<span class="dat2"><span class="smcap">Boston</span>, September 27.</span><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Mr. Gray</span>,&mdash;Can you drop into my
office to-morrow about noon? By some odd coincidence
I received a story very similar to your
&ldquo;April&rsquo;s Lady,&rdquo; and bearing the same title, several
days earlier, and should like to talk with you
about it.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="sign2">Very truly yours,</span><br />
<span class="sign1">J. Q. Lane.</span><br /></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>I was utterly confounded. I racked my
brains to discover who could possibly have
stolen my story, and even suspected the small
black girl who dusted my rooms, although
the sooty little morsel did not know one letter
from another. The first draft of the story
had lain in my desk for some time, it was
true, yet that any literary burglar should
have forced an entrance and then contented
himself with copying this seemed, upon the
whole, scarcely probable. I ransacked my
memory for some old tale which I might
unconsciously have plagiarized, but I could
think of nothing; and, moreover, I reflected
that the coincidence of names certainly could
not be accounted for in this way, even did I
recall the germ of my plot.</p>

<p>I presented myself at the office of the
&ldquo;Dark Red&rdquo; at the hour appointed with a
clear conscience, it is true, but with positively
no suggestion whatever to offer in regard to
the method by which a copy of my story
could have reached the editor in advance of
my own manuscript.</p>

<p>Mr. Lane received me with the conventionally
cordial manner which is as much a part
of editorial duties as is the use of the blue
pencil, and without much delay came to the
business of the call.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;There is something very singular about
this affair,&rdquo; he said, laying out my manuscript,
and beside it another which I could
see was written in a running feminine hand.
&ldquo;If the stories were a little more alike, I
should be sure one was copied from the
other; as it is, it is inconceivable that they
have not at least a common origin. Where
did you get your idea?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, so far as I know,&rdquo; I replied in perplexity,
&ldquo;I evolved it from my inner consciousness;
but the germ may have been the
unconscious recollection of some incident or
floating idea. I&rsquo;ve tried to discover where I
did get the fancy, but without a glimmer of
success. Who sent you the other version?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A lady of whose integrity I am as sure as
I am of yours. That&rsquo;s the odd part of it.
Besides, you are both of you too clever to
plagiarize, even if you weren&rsquo;t too honest.
The mere similarity of theme isn&rsquo;t so strange;
that happens often enough; but that the title
of the stories should be identical, and that in
each the heroine should be named May&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is her heroine named May?&rdquo; I interrupted
in astonishment; &ldquo;why, then, she
must have seen my copy; or,&rdquo; I added, a
new thought striking me, &ldquo;she must have
got the name in the same way I did. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
took the title of the story and the name of
the heroine from a line of Swinburne, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; interrupted the editor in turn,
catching up the manuscript before him, &ldquo;so
did she.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And he showed me, written at the head of
the page:&mdash;</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;If you were April&rsquo;s lady, and I were lord of May.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I remarked, with a not unnatural
mingling of philosophy and annoyance, &ldquo;it is
all of a piece with my theory that ideas are
in the air, and belong, like wild geese, to
whoever catches them first; but it is vexatious,
when I captured a fancy that particularly
pleased me, to find that some woman or
other has been smart enough to get salt on
its tail-feathers before I did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Lane smiled at my desperate air, and
at that moment his little office-boy, whom
I particularly detest because of the catlike
stillness and suddenness of his movements,
silently produced first himself and then a
card.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Agnes Graham,&rsquo;&rdquo; read Mr. Lane. &ldquo;Here
is your rival to speak for herself. I hope
you don&rsquo;t mind seeing her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, by no means,&rdquo; I replied rather ungraciously.
&ldquo;Let us see what she is like, and
what she will have to say about this puzzle.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>The name was not wholly new to me,
as I had seen it signed to various magazine
articles, concerning which at this moment I
had only the most vague and general idea.
I was sitting with my back to the door, and
in rising I still kept my face half turned away
from the lady who entered, but I saw the
reflection of her face in a mirror opposite
without any sense of recognition. As she
advanced a step or two, however, and half
passed me, I knew her. The delicate ear, the
fine sweep of the neck, the knot of golden
brown hair, were all familiar. It was the
lady who had sat before me in the cars from
New York on that April day.</p>

<p>As she turned in recognition of Mr. Lane&rsquo;s
introduction, a faint flush seemed to show
that she too recognized me, although I was
unable to understand how she should know
me, since she certainly had not turned her
head once in the entire journey. I set it
down to pure feminine intuition, not having
wholly freed myself from that masculine
superstition which regards woman&rsquo;s instinct
as a sort of supernatural clairvoyance.</p>

<p>My sensations on discovering her identity
were not wholly unlike those of a man who
inadvertently touches a charged Leyden jar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo; I exclaimed, &ldquo;what a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
psychological conundrum, or whatever you
choose to call it. The whole matter is as
plain to me now as daylight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; Mr. Lane asked, while Miss
Graham regarded me with an air which
seemed to question whether my insanity
were of a dangerous type.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pardon me, Miss Graham, if I cross-question
you a little,&rdquo; I went on, becoming somewhat
excited. &ldquo;You came from New York
on the morning train on Wednesday, the
fifteenth&mdash;no, the sixteenth of last April, did
you not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered, her color again a
trifle heightened, but her appearance being
rather that of perplexity than of self-consciousness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And on the way you read Swinburne till
you came to the line,</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;If you were April&rsquo;s lady, and I were lord of May,&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noi">and it occurred to you what a capital name
for a story &lsquo;April&rsquo;s Lady&rsquo; would be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she repeated; and then, with a yet
more puzzled air, she turned to Mr. Lane to
ask, &ldquo;Is this mind-reading?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; returned he.
&ldquo;Mr. Gray can best tell what it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the rest of the way to Boston,&rdquo; I
continued, ignoring the interruption, &ldquo;you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
were elaborating your story. You took the
heroine&rsquo;s name from the same line, and had
a pun at the climax about the hero&rsquo;s becoming
&lsquo;lord of May.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Miss Graham retorted, beginning to
enter into the spirit of the situation. &ldquo;I deny
the pun, although I acknowledge the rest.
The pun I didn&rsquo;t even think of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you see I haven&rsquo;t read your manuscript,
but I own I fell so low that I put in
the pun myself. At least the old gentleman
with a scar on his cheek, who sat in the corner
of the car, gave you hints for&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The uncle,&rdquo; broke in Miss Graham, with
a gleeful laugh at the remembrance of the
oddity of the old gentleman&rsquo;s appearance.
&ldquo;But how in the world did you know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, he did me. We evidently had the
same mental experience; which proves, I
suppose, that we are literary Corsican brothers
or something of the sort.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the great question to be settled is,&rdquo;
Mr. Lane observed, bringing in, after some
further talk, the editorial consideration, &ldquo;whose
story this really is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Graham&rsquo;s, by all means,&rdquo; I said instantly.
&ldquo;Hers was first in the field, and if I
hadn&rsquo;t impertinently looked over her shoulder,
I shouldn&rsquo;t have had any share in it whatever.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Graham laughed, showing a delicious
dimple, and Mr. Lane, who evidently had no
desire to settle the question under discussion,
looked inquiringly at her for a response to my
words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are very generous, Mr. Gray,&rdquo; she
answered; &ldquo;but in the first place my story
has never been accepted for the &lsquo;Dark Red,&rsquo;
and in the second, as the stories really ought
to stand on their merits, I shall certainly not
venture to put mine into competition with
yours, but prefer to pocket my manuscript
and retire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fear,&rdquo; was my reply, &ldquo;that I discover
rather a tendency to sarcasm in what you say
than any true humility. Of course the first
point is one for Mr. Lane to settle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The editor cleared his throat with some
embarrassment, but before he found the words
he wanted, Miss Graham spoke again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had not the slightest idea of being sarcastic,
for, of course, it goes without saying
that your story is better than mine; but since
you choose to take it in that way, I am willing
to leave the whole matter to Mr. Lane.
He is at least the only person who has read
both manuscripts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really,&rdquo; Mr. Lane said, thus pushed into
a corner, &ldquo;I am extremely sorry to find myself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
placed in so trying a situation. There
are points in which each story excels, and
the best result would undoubtedly be attained
by welding them together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If that could be done,&rdquo; said Miss Graham,
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, in Mr. Gray&rsquo;s version,&rdquo; he continued,
&ldquo;the heroine is more attractive and real.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; I interpolated, trying to cover the
awkwardness I felt by a jest, &ldquo;is the first
time in all my literary experience that the
character I thought best in a story I&rsquo;d
written has seemed so to the editorial
mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The dark eyes of my neighbor gave me a
bright, brief glance, but whether of sympathy
with my statement or of contempt for the
feebleness of my attempts at being jocose, I
could not determine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;While Miss Graham,&rdquo; went on the editorial
comment, &ldquo;has decidedly the advantage
in her hero.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Graham flushed slightly, but offered
no remark in reply to this opinion beyond a
smile which seemed one of frank pleasure.
We sat in silence a moment, a not unnatural
hesitancy preventing my making a proposition
which had presented itself to my
mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;If it will not seem impertinent to Miss
Graham,&rdquo; I ventured at length, &ldquo;I would
propose that we really do try the experiment
of collaboration on this story. I have never
worked with anybody, but I promise to be
tractable; and the thing had so odd a beginning
that it is a pity to thwart the evident
intention of destiny that we shall both have a
hand in it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To this proposition the lady at first returned
a decided and even peremptory negative;
but my persuasions, seconded by those
of Mr. Lane, who was partly curious and
partly anxious to escape from the necessity
of arbitrating in the matter, in the end induced
her to alter her decision.</p>

<p>The result of the interview was that when
we left the office of the &ldquo;Dark Red&rdquo; Miss
Graham had my manuscript and I hers, and
that an appointment had been made for my
calling upon her with a view to an interchange
of comments and criticisms.</p>

<p>Upon the appointed evening I presented
myself at the home of Miss Graham, and almost
without the usual conventionalities concerning
the weather we proceeded to discuss
the stories. We began with great outward
suavity and courtesy the exchange of compliments,
which were so obviously formal and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
perfunctory that in a moment more we looked
into each other&rsquo;s faces and burst into laughter
which if hardly polite was at least genuine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;now the ice is broken
and we can say what we really think; and I
must be pardoned for saying that that hero
of yours, whom Mr. Lane praised, is the
most insufferable cad I&rsquo;ve encountered this
many a day. He can&rsquo;t be set off against
that lovely girl in my story. Why, the truth
is, Miss Graham, I meant her to be what I
fancied you might be. She&rsquo;s the ideal I
built up from seeing you in the cars.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must say,&rdquo; Miss Graham retorted with
spirit, &ldquo;that if you meant that pert heroine
of yours for <em>me</em>, I am anything but complimented.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a pity, then, that you didn&rsquo;t intend
your hero for me, and we should have been
more than quits.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She blushed so vividly that a sudden light
burst upon me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo; I exclaimed, &ldquo;he does
have my eyes and beard; but you didn&rsquo;t see
me. It isn&rsquo;t possible&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it is,&rdquo; interrupted she, desperately.
&ldquo;With a mirror in the end of the car
directly before me all the way from New
York, do you suppose I could help seeing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
you! I&rsquo;m sure you kept your eyes on me
steadily enough to give me a good excuse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I whistled rudely; whereat she looked
offended, and we went on from one thing to
another until we had got up a very respectable
quarrel indeed. There is nothing more
conducive to a thoroughly good understanding
between persons of opposite sex than a
genuine quarrel; and having reached the
point where there was no alternative but to
separate in anger or to apologize, we chose
the latter course, and having mutually humbled
ourselves, after that got on capitally.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is my deliberate conviction,&rdquo; she observed,
when we at length got upon a footing
sufficiently familiar for jesting, &ldquo;that this
story is really mine, and that you purloined it
from me by some mysterious clairvoyance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That may be,&rdquo; I admitted. &ldquo;I once
guessed that a man was a bartender by the
way he stirred his coffee at the steamer table,
and that got me a very pretty reputation as a
seer for a day or two; and very likely the
truth is that I was all the time a mind-reader
without knowing it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She smiled good-naturedly&mdash;more good-naturedly,
indeed, than the jest deserved; and
from that moment our acquaintance got on
famously. The story was far from advancing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
as rapidly, however. A very brief time sufficed
to reduce both versions of &ldquo;April&rsquo;s
Lady&rdquo; to hopeless confusion, but to build
from the fragments a new and improved
copy was a labor of much magnitude. Circumstances
moreover, conspired to hinder
our work. It was necessary that we verify
our impressions of material we had used, and
to do this we were obliged to attend the
theatre together, to read together various
poems, and together to hear a good deal of
music. A little ingenuity, and a common
inclination to prolong these investigations,
effected so great a lengthening out that it
was several months before we could even pretend
to be ready to begin serious work upon
the story; and even then we were far from
agreeing in a number of important particulars.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Agnes,&rdquo; I remarked, one February evening,
when we were on our way home from a
concert to which we had boldly gone without
even a pretence that it was in the remotest
way connected with our literary project, &ldquo;I
fear we are becoming demoralized, and it
seems to me the only hope of our ever completing
&lsquo;April&rsquo;s Lady&rsquo; is to put everything
else aside for the time being and give our
minds to it. I can get my work arranged,
and you can finish those articles for &lsquo;The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
Quill&rsquo; by the middle of March. Then, we
can be quietly married and go to some nice
old-fashioned place&mdash;say St. Augustine&mdash;for
a couple of months and get this <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">magnum
opus</i> on paper at last.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As to being married,&rdquo; returned she sedately,
&ldquo;have you considered that we could
not possibly make a living, since we should
inevitably be always writing the same things?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, that is my chief reason,&rdquo; I retorted,
&ldquo;for proposing it. Think how awkward it is
going to be if either of us marries somebody
else, and then we write the same things. It
is a good deal better to have our interests in
common if our inventive faculty is to be so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is something in what you say,&rdquo;
Agnes assented; &ldquo;and it would be especially
awkward for you, since the invention is in my
head.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then we will consider it all arranged.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, George; by no means. I couldn&rsquo;t
think of it for a minute!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Whether she did think of it for a minute is
a point which may be left for the settling of
those versed in the ways of the feminine
mind; certain it is that the programme was
carried out&mdash;except in one trifling particular.
We were quietly married, we did go to St.
Augustine, but as for doing anything with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
the story, that was quite another thing. We
did not finish it then, and we have not finished
it yet, and I have ceased to have any
very firm confidence that we ever shall finish
it; although, whenever arises one of those
financial crises which are so painfully frequent
in the family of a literary man, and we sit
down to consider possible resources, one or
the other of us is sure sooner or later to
observe:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And then there is &lsquo;April&rsquo;s Lady,&rsquo; you
know.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>A CUBAN MORNING.</h2>


<p>[<i>Scene, the shady piazza of the hotel at Marianao,
Cuba. Time, nine o&rsquo;clock on a hot March morning.
Miss Peltonville and Arthur Chester tête-à-tête.</i>]</p>

<p><i>She.</i> Why did you follow us to Cuba?</p>

<p><i>He.</i> I have already told you that I thought you
were in Florida.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> Yes? And so you came to Marianao,
where nobody comes at this time of year, in order
that you might be perfectly safe from an encounter,
I suppose.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> Oh, I&mdash;that is; precisely.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> I had a letter from Annie Cleaves yesterday.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> Had you?</p>

<p><i>She.</i> Yes; and she said you told her that you
were coming to Cuba to find me.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> Oh, that&rsquo;s nothing. It isn&rsquo;t to be supposed
I told her the truth.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> Do you speak the truth so seldom, then?
Is there no dependence to be put on what you say?</p>

<p><i>He.</i> None whatever; otherwise I should be continually
hampered by the necessity of conforming
my actions to my words. You can see yourself
how inconvenient that would be.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<p><i>She.</i> For one who has had so little practice, very
likely; but then you would find it a novel experience,
I have no doubt.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> Ah, you have given me an idea. I&rsquo;ll try
it when all other novelties in life are exhausted.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> Don&rsquo;t put it off too long, or from the force
of habit you may find it impossible.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> You underrate my adaptability.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> Meanwhile I wish to know why you came.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> Since you are here yourself, you might be
supposed to regard the place as sufficiently interesting
to attract the traveller.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> Then you decline to tell me?</p>

<p><i>He.</i> Oh, no; I came because you amuse me.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> Thank you for nothing.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> And consequently I am in love with you,
as I did myself the honor to mention before you
left New York.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> Am I to understand that amusement is
your idea of love?</p>

<p><i>He.</i> Love certainly must be something that does
not bore one.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> But it seems a somewhat limited view to
take.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> Oh, it is only one way out of many; I
assure you I have quantities of ideas upon the subject,
all founded upon experience. I loved Lottie
Greenwell because she made a glorious champagne
cup. Indeed, for ten days I positively adored her,
until one night she put in too much curaçoa, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
realized how uncertain a foundation my passion
had. Then there was Elsie Manning. My passion
for her was roused entirely by her divine waltzing,
but I realized that it isn&rsquo;t good form for a man to
waltz with his wife, and I stood a much better chance
if she married some other man. After that came
Kate Turner; she writes so fascinating a letter that
I lost my heart every time I saw her handwriting
on the back of an envelope, although perhaps that
feeling you would call only a fancy, since nobody
would think of marrying on a virtue that is sure to
end with the wedding. A wife never writes to her
husband about anything but the servants and the
payment of her milliner&rsquo;s bills; so my flirtation
with her wouldn&rsquo;t really count as a love affair.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> You excel in nice metaphysical distinctions.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> Then there was Miss French. I loved her
because she snubbed me,&mdash;just as I loved Nora
Delaney for her riding, and Annie Cleaves for her
music.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> And now you love me, I am to understand,
as suited to the position of court jester to your
Royal Highness.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> One must have some sort of a reason for
being in love.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> But one needn&rsquo;t be in love.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> Oh, yes; life is very dull otherwise; and
besides, I have always thought it very stupid to
marry without having been in love a dozen times
at least. One is apt to lose his head otherwise;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
and how can he judge of the value of his passion
without having had a good deal of experience?</p>

<p><i>She.</i> So you advertise yourself as a marrying
man?</p>

<p><i>He.</i> Every bachelor is a marrying man. It is
only a question of finding a convenient wife.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> Like a convenient house, I suppose.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> Exactly.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> I wonder any woman ever consents to
marry a man.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> They know their own sex too well to be
willing to marry a woman.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> But men are such selfish creatures!</p>

<p><i>He.</i> You are amazingly pretty when you toss
your head that way. It is worth coming from New
York to see.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> It is well you think so; otherwise you
might consider your voyage a waste of time.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> What, with the certainty of your consenting
to marry me?</p>

<p><i>She.</i> I like your assurance! Why should I
marry you?</p>

<p><i>He.</i> I supposed that with your sex the fact of
my amazing attachment would be a sufficient
reason.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> Your knowledge of our sex is then remarkably
limited. Apparently, whether I happen to
love you is of no particular consequence.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> Oh, love is said to beget love.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> But you love me, you say, because I amuse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
you. Now you don&rsquo;t amuse me in the least, and
as I do not know just how to cultivate a passion
simply on the rather doubtful ground of your affection,
especially with the chance of its being transient,
there really seems to be very little chance of
reciprocity.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> Do you know what a tremendously hot
day it is?</p>

<p><i>She.</i> I don&rsquo;t see the connection, and I am sure
I am cool enough.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> But you make it very hot for me! How
picturesque that ragged fellow over there looks,
riding on the top of his high saddle.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> With a string of mules tied to his horse&rsquo;s
tail. I am fond of the mules, their bells are so
musical.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> And their bray.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> And the muleteers sing such weird songs.
I hear them going by about four o&rsquo;clock in the
morning, on their way to the Havana market, and
the effect is most fascinating.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> I should have expected you to be fond of
the mules.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> Why?</p>

<p><i>He.</i> A fellow feeling is said to have a softening
effect, and the mule&rsquo;s strongest characteristic is&mdash;</p>

<p><i>She.</i> Consistency!</p>

<p><i>He.</i> And as I was about to remark, we are apt
to value others most for the virtues we do not ourselves
possess.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>

<p><i>She.</i> You are sufficiently rude.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> There is always danger that honesty will be
thought rude.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> Really, you begin to amuse me. Please go
on; I would like to try falling in love on the
amusement plan; it must be very droll.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> Oh, bother the amusement! Like the
young ladies in novels, I would be loved for myself
alone.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> I fear that would be more difficult than the
other way. What have you ever done to make me
admire you?</p>

<p><i>He.</i> Perhaps nothing. Admiration presupposes
the capability of appreciation.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> Ah! What have you done, then, worthy
of admiration?</p>

<p><i>He.</i> I have managed to find you at Marianao,
and bring about a tête-à-tête before I have been
here fifteen hours.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> Wonderful man! And of all that, what
comes?</p>

<p><i>He.</i> That I ask you to marry me. That is certainly
something.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> Yes; it isn&rsquo;t much, and you have done it
before. But as you say, it is certainly something.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> You are always flattering! Really, one
wouldn&rsquo;t have expected you to be light now, when
it is my deepest affections and all that sort of
touching thing with which you are trifling.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> You are a humbug!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p><i>He.</i> Of course; so are you; so is everybody.
Civilization is merely the apotheosis of humbug.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> My friend, that trick of striving after epigram
is fast making you as bad as a confirmed
punster.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> Still, it is all true. I am a humbug in proposing
to you; you, if you reject me&mdash;</p>

<p><i>She.</i> I certainly do, most emphatically and
finally!</p>

<p><i>He.</i> You make me the happiest of men.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> You make your system of humbug far too
complicated for me to follow.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> Why, this is genuine.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> Anything genuine from you, I fear, is impossible.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> Oh, no; I have to be genuine occasionally,
for the sake of contrast. The humbug was in asking
you to marry me, and I wouldn&rsquo;t have had you
say yes for the world.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> I never suspected you of insanity, Mr.
Chester. Am I to infer that the climate of Cuba,
or the wines&mdash;</p>

<p><i>He.</i> Oh, neither, I assure you. Besides, Cuba
has no wines, as you ought to know. Now, see;
I&rsquo;ll do you the rare honor of telling you the truth.
Of course, you are at liberty to believe it or not, as
you please; and very likely you won&rsquo;t, because it
happens to be as true as the Gospel, revised version.
Some days since, I asked Annie Cleaves to
marry me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>

<p><i>She.</i> What particular thing had she been playing
to rouse you to that point of enthusiasm?</p>

<p><i>He.</i> If my memory serves me, it was the Chopin
Nocturne in G minor. She did play extremely well,
and as we happened to be in the conservatory
afterward, I improved the opportunity to propose.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> Oh, very naturally!</p>

<p><i>He.</i> It is a form of words that comes very readily
to my lips, as you know. Annie confessed to
that very superfluous and old-fashioned sentiment
called love, which wasn&rsquo;t in good form, I&rsquo;ll admit;
but in consideration for the object of her attachment,
and the fact that on that particular evening
I was in love myself, I managed to overlook it.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> Very good of you, I&rsquo;m sure. I hope
Annie appreciated your generosity.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> Very likely she didn&rsquo;t. Your sex very seldom
do appreciate masculine virtues; but Annie
has a far more old-fashioned and worse vice than
love. Why, the girl, in the midst of these enlightened
nineteenth-century days, actually goes to
the nonsensical bother of keeping a conscience!
It must be more trouble to attend to, Agnes, than
her aunt Wheeler&rsquo;s seven pet poodles and three
red-headed parrots.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> I suppose you are right. You don&rsquo;t speak
from experience, though, do you?</p>

<p><i>He.</i> Oh, no; I never had a conscience: as a
boy, I preferred white mice; now I have my
horses, you know.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p><i>She.</i> And your innumerable loves.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> If such trifles are to be taken into account.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> Go on about Annie.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> Well, on my confessing how far I had carried
my flirtation with you&mdash; I can&rsquo;t, for the life
of me, tell how I happened to speak of it; I am
usually more discreet.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> I should hope so.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> Oh, I am, I assure you; but the loves are
so numerous, while I am but one, that they sometimes
get the better of my discretion. What is one
among so many?</p>

<p><i>She.</i> Oh, in this case, absolutely nothing.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> Thank you again.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> But to continue&mdash;</p>

<p><i>He.</i> Well, to continue, Annie actually seemed
to think that you had some sort of claim upon me.
Fancy!</p>

<p><i>She.</i> She needn&rsquo;t have troubled.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> Oh, of course not. Why, I have offered
myself to dozens of girls, with no more idea of
marrying them than I have of becoming a howling
dervish; and more than that, I have habitually
been accepted. That is one thing about you that
attracted me, do you know? There is a beautiful
novelty about being rejected.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> So that is the secret of my amusing you, is
it? You ought to have explained this to Annie.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> Oh, she wouldn&rsquo;t have understood. Like
every other girl, &rsquo;twas the personal application that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
she was touched by. You see she didn&rsquo;t know the
other girls, and she did know you; and she seems
to think your no more binding than any other
person&rsquo;s yes. Perhaps she knows that a woman&rsquo;s
negative&mdash;</p>

<p><i>She.</i> Really, Arthur, that&rsquo;s so hackneyed that if
you haven&rsquo;t the gallantry not to say it you ought
to be ashamed to repeat anything so stale.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> Perhaps you are right; I have known you
to be on very rare occasions. However, Annie
insisted that I should come, and, as she said,
&ldquo;assure myself of your sentiments and of my
own.&rdquo; Did you ever hear anything more absurd?
As if I didn&rsquo;t know, all the time, that you were
dying for me; and as if I&mdash;despite my mad and
overpowering passion for your lovely self, Miss
Peltonville&mdash;couldn&rsquo;t tell as well in New York as
in Cuba whether I wanted to marry her or not.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> If you were no better informed of your
own sentiments than of mine, I don&rsquo;t wonder she
doubted your conclusions.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> Oh, she didn&rsquo;t in the least.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> At least, Annie may set her mind quite at
rest, so far as I am concerned.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> Thank you so much. It is such a relief to
have things settled.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> What would you have done if I had accepted
you?</p>

<p><i>He.</i> Oh, I was confident of my ability of putting
the question so that you wouldn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>

<p><i>She.</i> I have almost a mind to do it, even now.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> Really?</p>

<p><i>She.</i> Oh, don&rsquo;t be alarmed. There is one insuperable
obstacle.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> What is that?</p>

<p><i>She.</i> Yourself.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> Then I am quite safe. That is a permanent
one.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> Well, I wish Annie joy of her bargain. She
is worthy of a better fate; and since we are talking
frankly, I must say that what she can see in you I
can&rsquo;t imagine.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> These things are so strange; there is no
accounting for them. Why, I have been perfectly
puzzled&mdash;do you know?&mdash;ever since I came last
night, to tell what I found in you last winter.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> Since we seem to be striving to outdo each
other in abuse, it is quite in keeping for me to add,
that I have no occasion to bother my head on such
a question, for I never pretended to have found
anything in you.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> But then, as I said, you amused me; and
one may sometimes be so far amused that&mdash;</p>

<p><i>She.</i> His amusement may even amount to astonishment,
perhaps; and, by the way, that gentleman
on the gray horse, just coming between
the China laurels with papa, expects to marry
me.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> Fred Armstrong, by all that is unspeakable!
Agnes Peltonville, I humble myself in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
dust before you; and no humiliation could be
greater than going down into Cuban dust. You
are an angel; you have removed my last fear.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> Yes; and how?</p>

<p><i>He.</i> I was always jealous of Fred Armstrong;
he was forever dangling about Annie. Do I understand
that you are engaged?</p>

<p><i>She.</i> Oh, I didn&rsquo;t say that I expected to marry
him; but since Annie confesses such a strong attachment
to you&mdash;</p>

<p><i>He.</i> Oh, I didn&rsquo;t say I was the object of the
attachment.</p>

<p>[<i>They sit confronting each other in silence a moment,
until the riders, having dismounted, are seen
approaching the piazza. Then Chester leans forward
impulsively, and speaks with a new intensity.</i>]</p>

<p><i>He.</i> Agnes!</p>

<p><i>She.</i> Arthur!</p>

<p><i>He.</i> Quick! Before they come! You won&rsquo;t
send me away?</p>

<p><i>She.</i> But&mdash;</p>

<p><i>He.</i> No, no more nonsense; I am in dead earnest
now. You know I couldn&rsquo;t live without you,
or I shouldn&rsquo;t have followed you to Cuba.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> And Annie Cleaves?</p>

<p><i>He.</i> Oh, if you had a letter from her yesterday,
you must know she&rsquo;s engaged to Bob Wainwright.
Is it yes?</p>

<p><i>She.</i> (<i>rising.</i>) It would be a pity that you
should have come so far for nothing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<p>[<i>As he rises also he manages to catch her hand,
which he clasps joyously before the pair go forward to
meet the new-comers.</i>]</p>

</div>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">To</span> an ordinary observer, nothing
could be more commonplace than
Kempton, a decrepit little apology
for a village, lying on the coast of
Maine. Properly speaking, however, no sea-port
can be utterly commonplace, with its
suggestion of the mystery of the sea, the
ships, the sailors who have been to far lands,
the glimpses of unwritten tragedies on every
hand. But among sea-side villages Kempton
was surely dull enough, and dry enough, and
lifeless enough,&mdash;as if the sea-winds had
sucked its vitality, leaving it empty and pallid
and juiceless, like the cockle-shells which
bleached upon its sandy beaches.</p>

<p>Yet Kempton had one peculiarity which
marked it as singular among all New England
towns. It had a woman to dig its graves.</p>

<p>Its one church stood stark and doleful upon
the hill at whose foot lay the rotting wharves;
and back from the church stretched the
church-yard in which the Kempton dead
took their long repose, scarcely more monotonous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
than their colorless lives. The sexton,
digging their last resting-places in the ochery
loam, might look far off toward the sea where
they had wrested from the grudging waters a
scanty subsistence; and the dead wives, if so
be that their ears were yet sentient, might
lie at night and hear below the beat of the
waves which afar had rolled over the unmarked
graves of their sailor husbands.</p>

<p>To and fro among the grass-grown mounds
the sexton went daily, quite unmindful of being
the unique feature of Kempton by belonging
to the weaker sex. With masculine
stride and coarse hands, her unkempt locks
blown by the salt winds, the woman went her
way and did her work with a steadfastness
and a vigor which might have put to shame
many a man idling about the boats under the
hill. She was not an old woman,&mdash;not even
middle-aged, except with the premature age
of toil and sorrow; but the weather-beaten
face, the stooping shoulders, and the faded
hair made her seem old. To look at her, it
was difficult to realize what her youth could
have been like, or to call up any image of
sweet or gracious maidenhood in which she
could have shared.</p>

<p>It was a gray November day. The white-caps
made doubly black the dark waves of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
the bay, and the bitter wind blew freshly
through the withered grass and stubble, chasing
the faded leaves over Kempton Hill until
they rushed about the old meeting-house like
a flight of terrified witches. A stranger was
driving slowly up the road from the next
town in an open carriage, and as he came to
the top of the hill he drew rein before the
church and looked about him.</p>

<p>His gaze was not that of one who beheld
the scene for the first time. He gazed down
at the irregular houses under the hill, cuddled
like frightened and weak-kneed sheep. He
looked over the bay to the lighthouse, looming
ghastly and white against the dark sea
and sky. His glance took in all the details
of the picture, cold and joyless, devoid alike
of warmth and color. He shivered and
sighed, his brows drooping more heavily yet
over his dark piercing eyes, and then turned
his gaze to objects nearer at hand.</p>

<p>Close by was the stark church, with
weather-beaten steeple, wherein half a dozen
generations of Kempton women,&mdash;the men,
for the most part, being at sea,&mdash;had worshipped
the power of the storm, praying
more for the escape from evil of the absent
than for good to themselves. Beyond the
church appeared the first headstones of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
graveyard, the ground sloping away so rapidly
that little more than the first row of slate
slabs was visible from the street. With another
shiver Mr. Farnsworth (for by that
name the gentleman played his part upon
this world&rsquo;s stage) got down from his carriage,
fastened his horse, and walked toward
the stones, whose rudely chiselled cherubs
leered at him through their tawny rust of
moss with a diabolic and sinister mirthfulness.</p>

<p>As Mr. Farnsworth opened the sagging
and unpainted gate of the enclosure, he became
aware that the place was not empty.
The head and shoulders of a human being
were visible half-way down the hill, now and
then obscured by the dull-reddish heap of
earth thrown up from a partially dug grave.</p>

<p>The visitor made his way down the irregular
path, so steep as to be almost like a rude
flight of stairs, and as he neared the worker,
he suddenly perceived, with something of a
shock, that the grave-digger was a woman.
She worked as if familiar with her task, a
man&rsquo;s battered hat pushed back from her
forehead, over which her faded hair straggled
in confusion, and across which certain grimy
streaks bore witness that she had not escaped
the primal curse, but labored in the sweat of
her brow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>

<p>Kempton&rsquo;s peculiarity in the matter of its
sexton had not come to the knowledge of the
stranger before, although he once had known
the village life somewhat intimately. He regarded
the woman with a double curiosity,&mdash;to
see what she was like and to discover
whether perchance he had ever known her.
He paused as he neared her, resting one
nicely gloved hand upon a tilted stone which
perpetuated the memory and recorded the
virtues of a captain who reposed in some
chill cave under the Northern seas. Some
slight sound caught the ear of the sexton,
who until then had not perceived his approach;
she looked up at him stolidly, and
as stolidly looked down again, continuing her
work without interruption. If there remained
any consciousness of the strangeness of
her occupation, or if there stirred any womanly
shame to be so observed, they were
betrayed by no outward sign. She threw up
the dull-yellow earth at the feet of the new-comer
as unmoved as if she had still only the
dwellers in the graves as companions of her
labor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you find this rather hard work,
my good woman?&rdquo; the gentleman inquired
at length, more by way of breaking the silence
than from any especial interest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the sexton returned impassively,
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s hard enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is rather unusual work for a woman,
too,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>To this very obvious remark she returned
no answer, a stone to which she had come in
her digging seeming to absorb all her attention.
She unearthed the obstacle with some
difficulty, seized it with her rough hands, and
threw it up at the feet of the stranger, who
watched her with that idle interest which
labor begets in the unconcerned observer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you always do this work?&rdquo; Farnsworth
asked at length.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; was the laconic return.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the old sexton,&mdash;Joe Grimwet,&mdash;is
he gone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The woman looked up with some interest
at this indication that the other had some
previous acquaintance with Kempton and its
people. She did not, however, stop her labor,
as a man would probably have stopped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s buried over yonder,&mdash;there
beyond the burdocks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The gentleman changed his position uneasily.
Some subtile disquietude had arisen
to disturb his serenity. The wind rustled
mournfully among the dry leaves, the pebbles
rattled against the spade of the grave-digger,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
increasing the sombreness of a scene
which might easily affect one at all susceptible
to outward influences. In such an atmosphere
a sensitive nature not unfrequently experiences
a certain feeling of unreality, as if
dealing with scenes and creatures of the imagination
rather than with actualities; and
Farnsworth, whatever the delicacy of his
mental fibre, was conscious of such a sense
at this moment. He hastened to speak again,
as if the sound of his own voice were needed
to assure him of the genuineness of the place
and scene.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how long has he been dead?&rdquo; he
asked. &ldquo;And his daughter; what became of
her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The grave-digger straightened herself to
her full height; brushing back her wind-blown
hair with one grimy hand, she raised
her face so that her deep-set eyes were fixed
upon the questioner&rsquo;s face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you knew Delia Grimwet?&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;When was you here before? It&rsquo;d go hard
for you to make her out now, if it&rsquo;s long
since.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is she here still?&rdquo; Farnsworth persisted,
ignoring her question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the sexton replied, suddenly sinking
back into the unfinished grave as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
frightened animal might retreat into its den.
&ldquo;Yes; she lives in the old place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Her and the boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He recoiled a step, as if the mention of a
child startled or repelled him. Yet to a close
observer it might have seemed as if he were
making an effort to press her with further
questions. If so his courage did not prove
sufficient, and he watched in silence while the
woman before him went steadily on with her
arduous work. Presently, however, he advanced
again toward the edge of the pit,
which was rapidly approaching completion
under her familiar labor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Should I find her at home at this time?&rdquo;
he inquired. &ldquo;Or would she be out at
work?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The woman started and crouched, much as
if she had received or expected a blow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s out, most likely,&rdquo; she replied in
a muffled voice. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be home along
about sundown.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Farnsworth lingered irresolutely a moment
or two, as if there were many things concerning
which he could wish to ask; but, as the
woman gave him no encouragement, he
turned at last and climbed the slippery, ragged
path up to the church, untethered his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
horse, and drove slowly down the hill to the
village.</p>

<p>Cap&rsquo;n Nat Hersey was just coming out of
the village store, and to him Farnsworth
addressed an inquiry where he might find
shelter for himself and horse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; the cap&rsquo;n responded, with the deliberation
of a man who has very little to say
and his whole life to say it in, &ldquo;well I dunno
but ye might get a chance with Widder
Bemis, an&rsquo; I dunno <em>as</em> ye could; but there
ain&rsquo;t no harm trying, as I knows of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Further inquiry regarding the whereabouts
of the domicile of the Widow Bemis led to
an offer on the part of Cap&rsquo;n Hersey to act
as pilot to that haven. He declined, however,
to take a seat in the buggy. The Cap&rsquo;n
had his own opinion of land-vehicles. A man
might with perfect assurance trust himself in
a boat; but, for his own part, the cap&rsquo;n had
no faith in those dangerous structures which
roam about with nothing better than dry land
under them. He walked along by the side
of the carriage, conversing affably with the
stranger under his convoy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it a queer notion to have a woman
for a sexton?&rdquo; Farnsworth asked, as they
wended along.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, yes,&rdquo; the captain returned reflectively.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
&ldquo;Yes, it is sort of curious. Folks
mostly speaks of it that comes here. It is
curious, if ye look at it that way. But it all
come about as natural as a barnacle on a
keel. Old Sexton Grimwet kept getting considerable
feeble, and Dele she took to helping
him with his work. She was sort of cut
off from folks, as ye may say, owing to having
a baby and no father to show for it, and
she naturally took to heaving anchor alone,
or leastways along with the old man. And
when the old man was took down with a languishment,
she turned to and did all his work
for him,&mdash;having gradually worked into it,
as you may say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The cap&rsquo;n paused to recover from his astonishment
at having been betrayed into so
long a speech; but, as the stranger had the
air of expecting him to continue, he presently
went on again:</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was them that wanted her turned
out when old Grimwet died. Some said a
woman of that character hadn&rsquo;t ought to have
no connection with the church, even to digging
its graves. But Parson Eaton he was
good for &rsquo;em&mdash;I&rsquo;ve always noticed that when
these pious men gets their regular mad up
they most generally have things their own
way; and he preached &rsquo;em a sermon about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
the Samaritan woman, and Mary Magdalene,
and a lot more of them disreputable Scripture
women-folks, and, though he never mentioned
Dele by name, they all knew what he was driving
at, and they wilted. &rsquo;Twas a pitiful sight
to see the girl a-digging her own father&rsquo;s grave
up there. Me and Tom Tobey and Zenas
Faston took hold and finished it for her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They moved on in silence a moment or
two. Farnsworth&rsquo;s gaze was fixed upon the
darkening bay, and no longer interrogated his
companion; but the latter soon again took
up his narrative:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas well the parson stood up for Dele,
too; women-folks is so cussed hard on each
other. They wouldn&rsquo;t ha&rsquo; let the girl live, I
believe. I always were of the notion there
warn&rsquo;t no harm in Dele. Some &mdash;&mdash; city chap
got the better of her. She never was over-smart,
but she was awful pretty; and I never
believed there was any harm in her. At any
rate, she digs a grave as well as a man, and
I guess them that&rsquo;s in &rsquo;em don&rsquo;t lay awake
none thinking who tucked &rsquo;em in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The house of the Widow Bemis was by
this time reached, and that estimable lady,
who in the summer furnished accommodations
to a boarder whenever that rare blessing was
to be secured in Kempton, readily undertook<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
the charge of Mr. Farnsworth and his horse
for the night. The latter was given into the
care of her daughter, for the frequent absences
of the men had accustomed the damsels
of Kempton to those labors which in inland
villages are more frequently left to their
brothers; and Farnsworth strolled off toward
the wharves, leaving the widow Bemis and
Cap&rsquo;n Hersey in an agony of curiosity in regard
to himself and his errand.</p>

<p>Whatever may have been Farnsworth&rsquo;s
feelings at the discovery that the daughter of
the dead sexton and the woman of whom
he had asked tidings of her were identical,&mdash;and
they must have been both deep and
strong&mdash;he had given no outward sign. But
now the settling of his brows, and the disquiet
apparent in his eyes betrayed his inward conflict.
He strolled out upon one of the rotting
wharves about which the tide lapped in
mournful iteration, folded his arms upon a
breast-high post, and stood gazing seaward.</p>

<p>The retrospect which occupied his mind
was scarcely more cheerful than the gray
scene which spread before his eyes. How
awful are the corpses of dead sins which
memory casts up, as the sea its victims!
The betrayal of a woman is a ghastly thing
when one looks back upon it stripped of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
garlands and enchantments of passion and
temptation; and to Farnsworth, with the
image fresh in his rememberance of that
faded, earth-stained woman digging a grave
upon the bleak hillside, the fault of his youth
seemed an incredible dream which only stubborn
and stinging memory converted into a
possibility. A retrospect is apt to be essentially
a plea for self against conscience; but
in his gloomy revery Farnsworth found scant
excuse for the wreck he had made of the life
of Delia Grimwet. He had gone away,
married, and lived honored and prosperous.
He would have forgotten, had not some nobility
of his nature prevented. With the
stubbornness of his race, he had fought long
and determinedly against his conscience, but
he had been forced to yield at last. The
death of his wife, to whom he had been tenderly
attached, had at once left him free to
make such reparation as might still be possible,
and had softened him as only sharp
sorrow can. He had come to Kempton with
the determination of finding Delia, and of
doing whatever could be done, at whatever
cost to himself.</p>

<p>He had been unprepared, however, for the
woman he found. He had left a fresh, beautiful
young girl; ten years had transformed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
her into a repulsive old woman. He had no
means of adequately measuring the force of
the storms of scorn and poverty and sorrow
which had beaten upon Delia Grimwet in the
years that had made of him the cultured,
delicately nurtured man he was. What man
ever appreciated the woe of the woman he
betrays? Indeed, what measure has a man
of the sorrow of any woman? Farnsworth
had painfully to adjust himself to a condition
of affairs for which he should have been prepared,
yet which took him absolutely by
surprise.</p>

<p>He lingered upon the bleak wharf, unconsciously
the object of much mildly speculative
curiosity, until the twilight began to fall.
Then with a shiver, no less of mind than of
body, he shook off his painful abstraction,
and turned his steps toward the path, once
well known, which led to the house of Delia
Grimwet. It seemed to him, as he paused a
brief instant with his hand upon the old
knocker, as if nothing here had changed in ten
years. The sunlight would have shown him
traces of decay, but in the gathering dusk
the house seemed a pallid phantom from the
past, unchanged but lifeless.</p>

<p>But his knock at once destroyed all illusions,
since it summoned the woman who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
belonged not at all to that past which he remembered,
but to the pitiful and too tangible
present. She held her guttering candle up
without a word, and, having identified him,
made him, without speaking, a signal to enter.</p>

<p>When Farnsworth had left her in the afternoon,
Delia crouched in the bottom of the
grave she was digging, her first feeling being
an unreasoning desire for concealment. She
thought she should remain passive if the sides
of the pit collapsed and buried her. In the
old days before her boy was born she had
been night after night out on the old wharves,
praying for courage to drown herself. After
the child came, her feelings changed, and she
longed only to escape and to take her son away
from the scorn and the sordid life which surrounded
them. Gradually she had become
hardened; hers was one of those common
natures to which custom and pain are opiates,
mercifully dulling all sensibilities. To-day
the appearance of her betrayer had revivified
all the old impressions, and for a moment
seemed to transport her to the early days when
her anguish was new. The keenest pangs of
sorrow stabbed her afresh, and she lived again
the bitter moments of her sin and shame.
Her instinct was to flee from the man whose
presence meant to her only pain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span></p>

<p>But habit is strong, and presently the
fading light reminded the sexton that her
work was still unfinished, and that Widow
Pettigrove, who was past all earthly tribulation,
must have her last bed prepared, whatever
the woe of the living woman who worked
at it with trembling hands and a sensation as
if a demon had clutched her by the throat.
Yet work was not unmerciful; it brought
some relief, since it served to dilute the
thought which rushed dizzyingly to her brain,
and by the time her toil was completed she
was steadier. When she opened the door to
Farnsworth she was not unlike her usual
stolid self. She perceived at a glance that he
had learned who she was, and she hoped in
a blind, aching way, that he had not betrayed
his presence to the neighbors, thus to re-awaken
all the old stinging flight of bitter
words.</p>

<p>Farnsworth followed Delia into the kitchen,
without even those greetings which habit
renders so involuntary that only in the most
poignant moments are they disregarded.
With their past between them it was not easy
to break the silence. Farnsworth seated himself,
and the woman stood regarding him.
There was in her attitude all the questioning,
all the agony, of her years of suffering. Her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
wrongs and her sorrows gave her a dignity
before which he shrank as he could not have
quailed under the most withering reproaches.
Whatever words he would have spoken&mdash;and
no man can come deliberately to so important
a crisis without formulating, even if
unconsciously, the plea which his self-defence
will make&mdash;were forgotten, or seemed miserably
inadequate now. What were words to
this woman, pallid and worn before her time
with privation, anguish, and unwomanly toil?
The contrast between his rich and careful
dress and her coarse garb, between his white
hands and her knotted fingers, between his
high-bred, pale face and her cowed, weather-beaten
countenance, was too violent not to be
apparent to them both,&mdash;as if they were in
some strange way merely spectators looking
dispassionately at this wretched meeting of
those who had once been passionate lovers.</p>

<p>With each moment the silence became more
oppressive; yet as each moment dragged
by it became more difficult to break the
stillness. Only a man utterly devoid of remorse
or feeling could have framed upon
his tongue commonplace phrases at such a
time. It seemed to Farnsworth as if he
were brought to judgment before the whole
universe. His throat became parched. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
longed to have the candle and the flames
flickering in the old fireplace go out in darkness,
and take from his sight the Nemesis
that confronted him.</p>

<p>He broke the silence at last with a cry:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, my God, Delia! What have I
done?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She wavered as she stood, putting out her
hand as if reaching for support. Then she
half staggered backward into a chair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is nothing I can say!&rdquo; Farnsworth
went on vehemently. &ldquo;There is nothing I
can do! I came here dreaming of making
reparation; but there is no reparation I can
make. There is nothing that can change the
past,&mdash;nothing that will undo what I have
done to you. Oh, my God! How little I
dreamed it would be like this!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said slowly, almost stupidly,
&ldquo;nothing can undo it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why did you not tell me?&rdquo; he began.
&ldquo;Why&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the words rebuked him before they
were spoken. He buried his face in his
hands, and again they were silent. What
the woman,&mdash;this woman who had never
been able to think much, even in her best
days, and who now was blunted and dulled
almost to stupidity,&mdash;what she felt in those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
bitter moments, who can tell? The man&rsquo;s
soul was a tumult of wild regret and unavailing
remorse, while she waited again for
him to speak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; Farnsworth said at length, a new
idea seizing him, &ldquo;but the&mdash;our child, Delia?
The boy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A shuddering seized her. Unused to giving
way to her emotions, she was torn by her
excited feelings almost to the verge of convulsions.
She clutched the arms of her chair
and set her teeth together. In her incoherent
attempts at thought, as she had delved
among her graves, there had occurred to her
the possibility that the father might sometime
take his child from her. Now this fear possessed
her like a physical epilepsy. Twice
she tried to speak, and only emitted a gurgling
sound as if strangling. He sprang toward
her, but a sudden repulsion gave her self-control.
She put out her hands as if to ward
him off.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, my boy, my boy!&rdquo; she cried, breaking
out into hysterical sobs. &ldquo;My boy, my
boy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She wrung her hands, and twisted them
together in fierce contortions which frightened
Farnsworth; but she still would not
allow him to approach her. She struggled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
for composure, writhing in paroxysms dreadful
to see.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, my child!&rdquo; she cried out, in a tone
new and piercing; &ldquo;no, no! not him! Oh,
God! You cannot have my boy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Farnsworth retreated sharply.</p>

<p>He had not considered this. Indeed, so
different was everything he found from everything
he had expected, that whatever he had
preconsidered was swept out of existence as
irrelevant. He was confronted with a catastrophe
in which it was necessary to judge
unerringly and to act instantly, yet which
paralyzed all his powers by its strangeness
and its horror. He groped his way back to
his chair and sat down, leaving the silence
again unbroken save by her convulsive
breathing and his deep-drawn sighs.</p>

<p>All at once a new sound broke in upon
them, and the mother started to her feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is coming!&rdquo; she gasped hoarsely.
&ldquo;I sent him away; but he has come back.
He could not keep away, my beautiful boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her face was illumined with a love which
wellnigh transfigured it. The door was opened
violently, and the boy came rudely in,&mdash;a
gaunt, rough whelp of a dozen summers,
defiant, bold, and curious.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I knew there was something up,&rdquo; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
young rascal observed with much self-complacency.
&ldquo;I knew when you sent me off
to stay all night that somebody&rsquo;s funeral was
comin&rsquo; off, and I was bound I&rsquo;d be here to
see it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Neither the mother nor the father returned
any answer. Ordinary feelings were so absolutely
swept away that the woman did not
even remember that she should have attempted
to quiet and to excuse the intruder.
Even the maternal pride which would usually
have been troubled by the impression the
child&rsquo;s rudeness must make upon her guest
was overwhelmed by the greater emotion
which possessed her whole being.</p>

<p>Farnsworth had never been more keenly
alive in every fibre of his being than at this
moment. All his family pride, his refined
tastes, his delicate nature, revolted from a
kinship with the ugly, uncouth child who
stood grinning maliciously upon his guilty
parents. His impulse, almost too strong to
be resisted, was to turn back and hide himself
again in the world from which he had come,&mdash;to
leave this woman and her loutish child
in the quiet and obscurity in which he had
found them. But he was nobler than his
impulses and had paid already too dearly for
rashness; the claim of a son upon the father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
who has brought him into the world grasped
his sense of justice like a hand of steel.</p>

<p>He rose to his feet firm and determined.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go away now,&rdquo; he said to the boy quietly,
but in a voice which even the urchin felt admitted
of no disobedience. &ldquo;I wish to talk
with your mother. I will see you to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Farnsworth,&rdquo; the mother said pleadingly.
&ldquo;Go to bed now. I will come to you
before long. That&rsquo;s a good boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boy slowly and unwillingly withdrew,
his reluctance showing how rare obedience was
to him, and the parents were once more alone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have given him my name,&rdquo; were
Farnsworth&rsquo;s first words, as the door closed
behind his son.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was father who did that. He said he
should remember to curse you every time the
name was spoken.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you?&rdquo; the other asked, almost with
a shudder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not care. Cursing could not change
things. Only I would not let him do it before
the boy. I didn&rsquo;t want him to know what
sort of a father he had.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the midst of his self-abasement some
hidden fibre of resentment and wounded
vanity tingled at her words; but he would
not heed it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not so wholly bad, Delia,&rdquo; he said in
a moment. &ldquo;I came back to marry you. It
will not change or mend the past; but it is
the best I can do now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is no use to talk of that,&rdquo; she returned
wearily; &ldquo;you and I are done with each
other. Even I can see that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was spent with the violence of her
emotions, and only longed to have Farnsworth
leave her. She was keenly sensitive
now of the nicety of his attire, the contrast
between him and her meagre surroundings.
The shamefacedness of the poor overwhelmed
her. She rose with uneven steps and trembling
hands, and began to put things to rights
a little. She snuffed the ill-conditioned candle,
and trimmed the fire, whose drift-wood sent
out tongues of colored flame. She set back
into their usual gaunt and vulgar order the
chairs which had been disturbed.</p>

<p>Farnsworth watched her with an aching
heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Delia,&rdquo; he said at length, &ldquo;come and sit
down. We must decide what it is best to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She obeyed him, although with evident
reluctance. All the brief dignity which her
elevation of mood had imparted had vanished
now, leaving her more haggard and worn
than ever. A faded, prematurely old woman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
she sat twisting her red, stained hands in a
vain attempt to hide their ugliness in the
folds of her poor dress. Even self-pity in
Farnsworth&rsquo;s breast began to vanish in the
depth of compassion which the sexton
excited.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Delia,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I must think for us
both, and for the boy. He must be considered.
For his sake we must be married.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was at once with a sense of relief and of
humiliation that he saw how she shrank from
this proposition. To have fallen from godhood
in the meanest woman&rsquo;s eyes is the
keenest thrust at man&rsquo;s pride. It gave Farnsworth
a new conception that the gulf between
them must look as impassable from her side
as from his. He had thus far been too much
absorbed in the sacrifices he himself was
making to consider that all the desirabilities
of his world would not appeal to her as to
him,&mdash;that its very fulness and richness
which so held and delighted him would confuse
and repel her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is of no use!&rdquo; he exclaimed, starting
up. &ldquo;I must have time to think. I will
come back in the morning. Think yourself,
Delia,&mdash;not of me, or even of yourself,
so much as of the boy. It is of him that we
must have the first care. Nothing can much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
change our lives; but the world is before
him. Goodnight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>However different may have been the reflexions
of Farnsworth and of Delia Grimwet
through that long, sad night, their conclusions
must have been in some respects identical,
for when the former came to the house in the
morning with the astonished clergyman the
woman acquiesced without any discussion in
the performance of the marriage ceremony.
It was an occasion which the Rev. Mr.
Eaton long remembered, and of which he
told to the end of his life, filling out, it must
be confessed, as time went on, its spare facts
with sundry incidents, trifling, it is true,
yet gradually overlaying the bare truth with
a completeness which the clerical gossip himself,
whose belief always kept pace with his
invention, was far from realizing. The only
thing he could with accuracy have told, beyond
the simple fact of the marriage, was that
when, according to his wont, he attempted to
add a few words of exhortation and moral reflection,
the bridegroom cut him short and
showed him to the door with a courtesy
perfect but irresistible, the rebuff somewhat
softened by the liberality of the fee which
accompanied the dismissal.</p>

<p>The boy during these singular proceedings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
had remained in a state of excited astonishment
almost amounting to stupefaction; but
when the newly united family were alone together,
his natural perversity broke out, and
showed itself in its natural and unamiable
colors. To the father the child&rsquo;s every uncouth
word and act were the most acute
torture; and the mother, partly by woman&rsquo;s
instinct, partly from previous acquaintance
with her husband&rsquo;s fastidiousness, was to
a great degree sensible of this. She made
no effort, however, to restrain her child. She
seemed to have thrown off all responsibility
upon the father, and busied herself in preparations
for the boy&rsquo;s departure, about which,
although neither had spoken of it, there
seemed to be some tacit understanding.</p>

<p>The forenoon was well worn when Farnsworth
came to the door with his carriage, for
which he had gone in person.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, Delia,&rdquo; he said, entering the house.
&ldquo;We may as well leave everything as it is. I
told Mrs. Bemis to lock up the house and
see to it. Are you ready?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Farnsworth is,&rdquo; she replied, seating herself
in a low chair and drawing to her side the
uncouth boy, who struggled to get free.</p>

<p>He broke in rudely, announcing his readiness,
his joy at leaving Kempton, and his satisfaction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
at wearing his Sunday jacket, which
to his father looked poor enough.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you, Delia?&rdquo; her husband inquired,
putting up his hand to quiet the child. &ldquo;Are
you ready?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not going.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Whether it was relief, remorse, or astonishment
which overwhelmed him, John
Farnsworth could not have told. He stood
speechless, looking at his wife like one suddenly
stricken dumb. The boy filled in the
pause with noisy expostulations, depriving
the tragedy of even the poor dignity of silence.
The father knew from the outset that
remonstrances would not be likely to avail,
yet he remonstrated; perhaps, for human
nature is subtle beyond word, he was unconsciously
for that reason the more earnest in
his pleading. He would have been glad
could this woman and her child have been
swept out of existence. Already he had to
hold himself strongly in check, lest the reaction
which had followed his heroic resolve
to marry Delia should show itself; but
he choked back the feeling with all his
resolution.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Delia persistently said, her eyes dry,
her voice harsh from huskiness. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no
place anywhere but here. It is too late now.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
I&rsquo;ve more feeling than I thought, for I do
care something even now to be an honest
woman in the sight of my neighbors; and
that&rsquo;ll help me bear it, I suppose. Take the
boy, and do for him all you owed to me. I
should spoil all if I went. He is best quit of
me if he&rsquo;s to please you and grow like you.
I&rsquo;ll stay here and dig graves; I am fit for
nothing else. I want nothing of you. I
married you for the boy&rsquo;s sake, and for his
sake I break my heart and send him away;
but I will have nothing for myself. The
days when I would have taken a penny from
you are long gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She spoke calmly enough, but with a certain
poignant stress which made every word
fall like a weight. He did not urge her
further. He held out his hand, into which
she laid hers lifelessly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;As God sees me,
Delia, I&rsquo;ll do my best by the boy. I will
write to you. If you change your decision,&mdash;but
no matter now. I will write to
you and to the minister.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All other words of parting were brief and
soon spoken. The boy showed no emotion
at leaving his mother, as he had throughout
exhibited no tenderness. He climbed noisily
into the carriage, and the father and son, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
strangely assorted, rode together up the hill,
past the stark meeting-house, and so on into
the world whose seething waves seldom
troubled, even by such a ripple as the events
just narrated, the dull calm of Kempton;
and to John Farnsworth it was as if the woful
burden of remorse which had so long
vexed heart and conscience had taken bodily
shape and rode by his side.</p>

<p>Delia had been calm until the two were
gone,&mdash;so calm that her husband thought
her still half dazed by the excitement and
anguish of the previous night. She stood
steadily at the window until the carriage
disappeared behind the grave-covered hill.
Then she threw herself grovelling upon the
floor in the very ecstasy of woe. She did
not shriek, strangling in her throat into inarticulate
moans and gurglings the cries which
rent their way from her inmost soul; but she
beat her head upon the bare floor; she
caught at the furniture like a wild beast,
leaving the print of her strong teeth in the
hard wood; she was convulsed with her
agony, a speechless animal rage, a boundless,
irrepressible anguish which could not be
measured or expressed. She clutched her
bosom with her savage hands, as if she
would tear herself in pieces; she wounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
and bruised herself with a fierceness so intense
as to be almost delight.</p>

<p>In the midst of her wildest paroxysm there
came a knocking at the door. She started
up, her face positively illuminated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They have come back!&rdquo; she murmured
in ecstasy.</p>

<p>She rushed to the door and undid its fastenings
with fingers tremulous from eager joy.
A neighbor confronted her, staring in dismay
and amazement at her strange and dishevelled
appearance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s come to ye, Dele?&rdquo; he demanded
roughly, though not unkindly. &ldquo;When ye
goin&rsquo; to put the box in Widder Pettigrove&rsquo;s
grave?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She confronted him for an instant with a
wandering look in her eye, as though she
had mercifully been driven mad. Then the
tyranny of life and habit reasserted itself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come up now, Bill,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>And she went back to her graves.</p>

<div class="ads">
<p>It is just the kind of a story to suit the majority of watering-place people who
wish to help pass the time with light reading. The scene is laid in Campobello;
and the social life at a sea-side resort, with its impromptu festivities, is attractively
set forth. The persons who form the principal group in the story are
above the usual watering-place gossips, that magnify every innocent flirtation
they see; and the lad who at twenty-one falls desperately in love with a charming
widow of thirty-five years, at last sensibly turns to the daughter, loves her and
marries her, through the shrewd management of her mother. The object of the
book is to show how often and how fervently a callow youth is attracted to some
one older and more cultivated than himself; and the analysis of his passion is
very well done.&mdash;<cite>Hartford Times.</cite></p>

<p>This time Mr. Bates, who wields a facile pen, has taken up a facile subject,
for the burden of his story is the evolution of a young man&rsquo;s love in the cool
shades and sylvan retreats of Campobello.... Incidentally he pictures certain
aspects of society and gives a fair account of Campobello. <cite>A Lad&rsquo;s Love</cite> is a
readable story, and young women will read it not only with pleasure but also with
profit. It will teach them how love acts in a pure lad.&mdash;<cite>The Beacon.</cite></p>

<p>Arlo Bates is favorably known as a writer of pleasant and healthy verse, and
he appears to equal advantage as the author of this bright novel, which is as
breezy as the air of Mount Desert, where the scene is laid. The &ldquo;Lad&rdquo; is a
youth of twenty-two or so, just through Harvard; and the depth, strength, and
variety of his love are well illustrated by his frantic passion for a widow old
enough to be his mother, by his rapid transfer of affection to her lovely daughter,
and by his nearly getting entangled with a third woman before he secures the
right one. There is a thorough-bred air about the book which leaves a good impression,
and a liveliness of fancy and description which promises more good
stories from Mr. Bates&rsquo;s pen. The minor characters, though merely sketched in
lightly, fill their places admirably, and the two heroines are quite delicious.&mdash;<cite>Pittsburgh
Bulletin.</cite></p>

<p>The author delights in making an analytical study of the mental condition of
the principal actors at various stages of the story, and now and then brightens the
pages with a crisp epigram that betrays a habit of close observation of human
nature in the lines of the story&rsquo;s theme.... The people of the story are lifelike,
however, and there is not an impossible nor even an improbable person
among them.&mdash;<cite>Springfield Union.</cite></p>

<p>These poems are always poetical; they are carefully finished; they
are not <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vers de société</i>; they do not affect American humor, and they are
utterly unpretentious. Mr. T.&nbsp;B. Aldrich might own a good many of
them. They reveal Mr. Bates&rsquo; mind and temper at their very best, and
will be enjoyed by those who have an ear for fine, light impressions finely
and delicately expressed.&mdash;<cite>The Beacon.</cite></p>

<p>The poems, all very short, except the &ldquo;Ballad of the Spinner,&rdquo; are
almost all flavorous with love&rsquo;s delicious essence. The perennial passion
receives fresh illumination in a hundred ways. Warmth, richness,
suggestiveness, smooth-flowing melody,&mdash;these are some of the traits of
Mr. Bates&rsquo; verses, which are well worthy the tasteful setting here given
them.</p>

<p>They are almost invariably the setting of some pretty and thoroughly
poetic thought; and the writer&rsquo;s expression is clear and precise, and
studded with bits of exquisite imagery.&mdash;<cite>Argonaut.</cite></p>

<p>There are many who will welcome another volume from the pen of
Arlo Bates, although it be a sad one. The twenty-nine sonnets which
make up this little collection are but variations of one melody, and that
played in the minor key. They will sink deep into many hearts, for they
are the expressions of various moods which all who have known grief
and loss will have felt and be able to comprehend. The men and women
who have no artistic gifts, and who sit and shed salt tears in stony silence,
unable to give their woe adequate words, will feel that a human heart
has here been revealed to them able to sympathize with every throb and
pulsation of their own. There is not a cry of a bruised soul but will find
its echo in some one of these sonnets, and the knowledge that they are
the expression of a real and personal sorrow gives them a power and
interest that no ideal or imaginary work could possess.&mdash;<cite>Transcript.</cite></p>

<p>A thoroughly wholesome story is <cite>A Woodland Wooing</cite>, by Eleanor Putnam
(the late Mrs. Arlo Bates). It is as sweet as a meadow of clover and as bright
as a crisp October morning. Its simplest events are made fascinating by their
rare naturalness. The motherless children of a country doctor figure prominently
in the tale, and they devise all sorts of original modes of amusing themselves, of
course omitting whatever is incompatible with self-respect or unapproved by conscience.
Boys and girls are for the most part the story&rsquo;s heroes and heroines,
and when they find themselves quite unexpectedly grown into men and women
and realize all that maturity means, their natures are strong and unhurt by the
evils of self-consciousness or of unwholesome speculations regarding the significance
of this life or the next. They are children of fine, vigorous intellectual
fibre and noble impulses that lead them toward worthiness, happiness, and usefulness,
and the story of their progress toward higher things is charmingly told.&mdash;<cite>The
Delineator.</cite></p>

<p>Like a cool breeze on a sultry day comes this little book, <cite>A Woodland Wooing</cite>,
by Eleanor Putnam, fresh and sparkling, with almost child-like fun, and not
even the shadow of a moral spectre to be found stalking anywhere between its
dainty covers.... The Yankee country-folks all around are photographed very
accurately to our mind&rsquo;s eye, and it is difficult to say whether they are more
amusing than the widely-travelled and elegantly-Bohemian family of Sparhawks,
whose advent in the village makes such a sensation. The infant Sparhawks are
especially droll, and remind one strongly of those famous personages, &ldquo;Toddy
and Budge.&rdquo; In fact it is just the sort of book to read aloud, so as to have some
one to laugh with over its joyous humor.&mdash;<cite>Home Journal.</cite></p>

<p>One of the breeziest, brightest books of the year. It is not only charmingly
original, but thoroughly amusing. Its characters are drawn with all the skill of
the literary artist, and stand out in the mind of the reader like beautiful pictures
upon the canvas. The reading will make old gray heads feel again young. It
will revive the visions of youth, with spring flowers, when all the world stretched
away in brightness. The story is a summer camping-out, told in alternate chapters
by a brother and sister, in which all sorts of people are introduced to the
reader in a most delightful and amusing way. It matters not that it contains
much nonsense; life needs a good deal of such to spice it up. The woodland
wooing, it may be remarked, is carried on under many and trying circumstances.
But it all ends well. It is indeed a bright, breezy, pleasing book, and tears will
only come in the remembrance that the hand that penned the lines has ceased
forever from such pleasing earthly tasks.&mdash;<cite>Chicago Inter-Ocean.</cite></p>
